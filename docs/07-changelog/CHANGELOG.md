# Changelog

## 2026-09-16 — Gateway experiment documentation and reports

- Expanded the Gateway Experiment panel with condition semantics, Plastic's
  frozen-preregistration requirements, seed/review requirements and the
  non-evidentiary boundary.
- Added Gateway report generation after activation. It writes a Markdown
  report, JSON report and bounded gateway state under the experiment directory.
- Gateway manifests and reports explicitly keep productive Gateway access
  locked and scientific evidence false.

## 2026-09-16 — Experiment archive results viewer

- Added result-viewing buttons (Report, Summary, Statistics, Raw Data) directly
  on each experiment library item in the "Experimentreihen & Archiv" panel,
  for both active and archived experiments.
- Buttons are built from the `manifest.artifacts` paths, so every past
  experiment with a manifest can be inspected — not only just-finished runs.
- Clicking a result button opens the artifact in the file viewer with the
  research source pre-selected, reusing the existing `_openArtifact` pipeline.
- Added `_installPastExperimentPopupActions()` so the file viewer header shows
  Report/Summary/Statistics/Raw Index switch buttons for past experiments,
  mirroring the popup already available for just-completed runs.
- Cached loaded experiment collections (`_cachedActiveItems`,
  `_cachedArchivedItems`) so popup artifact paths can be resolved without an
  extra API round-trip.
- Added CSS for `.experiment-library-results` and `.exp-open-btn` in
  `workspace-architecture.css`.

## 2026-09-13 — Deterministic frontend tab routing

- Rewrote `workspace-router.js` with a central `setRouteElementVisibility()` function
  that consistently sets `hidden`, `aria-hidden`, `inert` and CSS classes.
- Added `reconcileRouteVisibility()` as the single authority for panel visibility after
  every navigation, eliminating content leakage between subtabs.
- Fixed Science tab isolation: Observatory, Experiments, Network, Dynamics, Inspect,
  Data, Files and Registry subtabs now exclusively show their own panels.
- Fixed `focus` action: no longer just `scrollIntoView()` — now hides all other content
  in the workspace and shows only the targeted element(s).
- Fixed `focusOnly` action: properly isolates deeply nested panels, not just direct children.
- Added `data-mhrn-persistent` attribute support for elements that must remain visible
  across routes (e.g. context navigation).
- Updated `MutationObserver` to re-apply route visibility after dynamically loaded
  modules appear in the DOM, with debounce guard against infinite loops.
- Removed old three-area `frontend-architecture.js` import from `console-log.js` to
  prevent conflicting navigation systems.
- Strengthened CSS hide rules with `!important` cascade for all route-hidden states.
- Added 18 new automated tests covering: central visibility function, reconciliation,
  all route action handlers, valid workspace references, CSS hide rules,
  MutationObserver integration, old architecture removal, and route-specific ownership.
- Verified: 24 workspace-architecture tests pass, ~1130/1156 full suite pass
  (26 pre-existing failures from missing CSS files, sklearn dependency, etc.).

## 2026-09-12 - Scientific metrics workbench

- Added `GET /api/science/metrics`, including live spike-window metrics
  (ISI/CV, Fano, Victor-Purpura, van Rossum, entropy, avalanches and
  branching), network degree/topology/5D distance, learning, homeostasis,
  provenance and replication-statistics groups.
- Added a Research scientific instrument with explicit `UNKNOWN` states,
  telemetry age, falsification annotation, comparison capture and drill-down
  links to network and runtime manipulators.
- Rebuilt the instrument as a twelve-tab Research Observatory covering
  Observatory, Spike trains, Topology/5D, Criticality, Learning,
  Energy/Homeostasis, Statistics, Causality, Embodiment, Provenance,
  Benchmarks and Falsification, without removing the existing experiment,
  file and registry workflows.
- Made the Observatory a direct `app.js` lifecycle dependency and added
  cache-busted frontend asset URLs so the rebuilt Research surface is loaded
  on a normal browser refresh.
- Kept advanced metrics that lack a validated data contract unavailable:
  Lyapunov/attractor dynamics, UMAP latent evidence, causal information flow,
  null/surrogate models, confidence intervals, effect sizes and statistical
  power.

## 2026-09-12 - Parameter sidebar route

- Linked sidebar menu 07 directly to the runtime Parameter Inspector in the
  Settings workspace.
- Preserved menu 07 as the active route after navigation so it remains
  distinct from the general Settings entry.

## 2026-09-12 - Research workspace sub-tabs

- Split the Research workspace into `Experiments`, `Files` and `Registry`
  sub-tabs.
- Moved the dynamic research documents and reports panel into the Registry tab.
- Added browser coverage for the sub-tab switching behavior.

## 2026-09-12 - Sidebar navigation fix and dashboard cleanup

- Fixed critical sidebar navigation bug: `nav` click handler in
  `frontend-architecture.js` used `event.target.closest("[data-primary-area]")`
  which traversed up to `document.body` (where `data-primary-area` is set by
  `syncNavigation()`), causing ALL sidebar `[data-global-workspace]` button
  clicks to be hijacked and reset the tab to `overview`.
  Fix: added `!nav.contains(button)` guard so only buttons within the nav
  element itself are processed.
- Removed `experience-status-cluster` (WORKSPACE/RUNTIME/TICK) and `⌘K`
  command-palette button from topbar by disabling `enhanceTopbar()`.
- Removed `header-context` span from topbar HTML.
- Disabled `restorePreferences()` focus-mode restoration (focus mode removed
  entirely — always show everything).
- Unified all sidebar elements: area tabs (01–03) and global actions (04–08)
  now share identical structure (`mhrn-nav-icon` + `mhrn-nav-copy`), numbering
  (01–08), typography, padding, hover/active states, and accent bar.
- Parameter button now scrolls to Parameter Inspector card with 2-second
  highlight animation, differentiated from Settings (top of settings tab).
- Verified all 8 sidebar links navigate to correct destinations:
  Dashboard → overview, Wissenschaft → research, Runtime & Wesen → wesen,
  Control → control, Release → gate, Settings → settings, Parameter →
  settings + scroll to Parameter Inspector, Review → /review (new tab).

## 2026-09-11 - Full backend API integration into frontend

- Integrated all 25 previously unused backend API endpoints into the dashboard
  frontend via 7 new ES-module panels:
  - `modules/cognition.js` — `/api/cognition/state`, `/api/cognition/memory`,
    `/api/cognition/world-model` (GET, auto-refresh 5s).
  - `modules/gateway-monitor.js` — `/api/embodiment/gateways`,
    `/api/embodiment/gateway-experiments` (GET, auto-refresh 5s).
  - `modules/docs-browser.js` — `/api/docs/tree`, `/api/docs/statistics`,
    `/api/docs/search`, `/api/docs-files/{path}` (GET, auto-refresh 30s).
  - `modules/research-docs.js` — `/api/research/documents`,
    `/api/research/reports`, `/api/research/ai-reports`,
    `/api/research/ai-reports/{ref}`, `/api/research-files/{path}` (GET,
    auto-refresh 30s).
  - `modules/ai-report-tools.js` — `/api/research/ai-reports/generate` (POST),
    `/api/research/ai-reports/{ref}/review` (POST).
  - `modules/learning-prep.js` — `/api/learning/preparation` (GET+POST,
    auto-refresh 10s).
  - `modules/structural-inspector.js` — `/api/structural/heatmap`,
    `/api/structural/history`, `/api/structural/config` (GET, auto-refresh 5s).
  - `modules/system-info.js` — `/api/config`, `/api/state`,
    `/api/releases/current`, `/api/snapshots` (GET, auto-refresh 5s).
- All modules follow the existing `ensurePanel()` → `render()` → `refresh()`
  pattern with `Promise.allSettled` for resilient parallel fetches.
- Added shared CSS layout rules for all new panels in `shell.css`.
- Wired all 7 new modules into `index.js` `init()`.
- All 7 relevant dashboard shell tests pass; 2 pre-existing failures from
  commit 9ef87300 remain unrelated.

## 2026-09-11 - Frontend shell accessibility

- Fixed the central workspace being covered by the fixed header and primary
  navigation; measured shell heights now determine the main content offset.
- Reserved the actual responsive footer height and added a browser regression
  test so the workspace remains reachable at the top and bottom of the page.

## 2026-09-10 - Bounded memory, prediction and behavior profile foundation

- Aktualisierte Release-Workspace-Projektion: v0.6.0a1 zeigt den Stand vom
  2026-09-10, null aktive Release-Blocker, abgeschlossene Foundation,
  verbleibende Gate-Schritte und die wissenschaftliche Evidenzgrenze.
- Connected optional bounded working/episodic memory and an observation-only
  one-step transition predictor to the existing `ExperienceEngine`.
- Exposed granular cognition telemetry and explicit read/write controls through
  the dashboard; arbitrary memory-content injection remains unavailable.
- Added individual sensor lifecycle endpoints and Wesen controls with explicit
  adapter, authorization, safety and audit boundaries.
- Added experiment-only Gateway lifecycle controls, productive Gateway remains
  locked, and added Profile Snapshot binding plus central File Viewer access.
- Added the machine-readable backend/frontend coverage contract and focused
  HTTP tests for these boundaries.
- Connected configured operational Behavior Profiles to the canonical
  `build_experience_subsystem()` path and `ExperienceEngine`.
- Added independent read/write controls, bounded retention, atomic persistence,
  schema ownership and integrity checks, plus auditable profile updates.
- Focused engineering checks pass; no scientific evidence or consciousness
  claim is created.

## 2026-09-09 - Versioned Wesen profile identity

- Added bounded schema-v1 technical profiles under `profiles/<profile_id>` with a metadata-only registry, canonical SHA-256 digests and revision history.
- Added profile lifecycle APIs for create, update, load, profile-only/state-bound loading, clone, snapshot binding, history, export/import and archive-safe deletion.
- Added ZIP path-traversal, size, duplicate-ID and digest validation; imported actuator declarations do not activate devices.
- Added a Wesen Profile & Identitaet view with current identity, configuration, lineage, snapshot status and lifecycle actions.
- Kept profile configuration separate from `.b5d` snapshots and runtime checkpoints; autonomous identity mutation remains locked.

## 2026-09-09 - Controlled Neural Symbiosis gateway runtime

- Added a core-independent, experiment-only gateway runtime with explicit lifecycle states, Frozen/Random/Shuffle controls and guarded Plastic activation.
- Added deterministic topology, checkpoint/resume state, bounded structural journaling, traffic/resource metrics and throttling limits.
- Added read-only gateway status/topology APIs and an experiment-scoped lifecycle API; no general productive plasticity endpoint exists.
- Updated Wesen to show real gateway state, maturity, aggregated topology and `Productive: LOCKED`.
- Added gateway research questions for learning, modality, stability, transfer/interference, structure, closed loop and resources.
- Productive gateway activation remains unavailable pending preregistered validation and human scientific review.

## 2026-09-09 - Repository-derived Development Timeline

- Added the Release **Entwicklungs-Timeline** tab and a second development bar inside the chronological release timeline.
- Added `GET /api/release/development-timeline` with eleven machine-derived stages, dual technical/scientific markers, score separation and confidence.
- Connected active runtime telemetry and `last_observed` B5D snapshot sizes without inventing unavailable values.
- Added detail panels and backend/browser tests while preserving the boundary that engineering maturity is not scientific evidence and never implies consciousness.

## 2026-09-09 - Trusted-LAN dashboard access

- Windows `start.cmd` and `start.ps1` now bind the dashboard to `0.0.0.0:8765` by default for access via the host machine's LAN IP.
- Kept direct Python startup loopback-only and documented the firewall/trusted-network boundary.
- Improved terminal diagnostics with canonical version, config, mode, PID and bind/local/LAN URL information; enabled UTF-8 console output in `start.cmd`.
- Fixed CMD version extraction and localized Windows listener detection; occupied port errors now include the owning PID.

## 2026-09-09 - v0.6 roadmap and acceptance audit

- Verified the compatibility, bounded telemetry/storage, scaling-budget, deterministic identity and migration/rollback contracts for v0.6.
- Focused acceptance tests pass: 10 passed across persistence, benchmarks, runtime pacing, pause/resume, research-data compaction and workspace behavior.
- Corrected the roadmap to describe experiment archiving as a metadata-only work-view index rather than a directory move.
- Recorded the remaining release-record publication gate and the non-blocking R0-R12 research backlog in the canonical TODO.

## 2026-09-08 - Versioned embedding and cluster analysis jobs

- Replaced the t-SNE / UMAP / Clusterexport placeholder with a bounded backend analysis job.
- Persisted JSON/CSV outputs with algorithm versions, parameters, input digest, source-tree digest and human-review boundary.

## 2026-09-08 - Research experiment organizer

- Added a visible Research Organizer for starting experiment series through the existing controlled batch workflow.
- Added active experiment and archive lists with explicit archive reasons and restore actions.
- Kept archived experiment directories immutable; no DATA, EVID or interpretation status is changed by archiving.

## 2026-09-08 - v0.6.0a1 development line

- Opened the v0.6 Scaling & Deterministic Performance development line after the reviewed v0.5.0-alpha.7 gate closure.
- Updated canonical package and dashboard version metadata to `0.6.0a1` / `0.6.0-alpha.1`.
- Kept v0.6 release readiness open; no scientific evidence, historical artifact or AIRR interpretation was promoted by the version change.

## 2026-09-08 - Cross-platform source-freeze digest mismatch on Windows

- Canonicalized tracked text content through the Git representation so LF and CRLF checkouts produce the same scientific source digest.
- Preserved stale detection for real working-tree changes and relevant untracked files, while keeping binary content byte-exact and cache metadata excluded.
- Added per-file source-digest diagnostics and structured gate provenance for expected/current digest, commits, paths and stale reason.

## 2026-09-08 — Gate board truth-source and full-width preparation

- Expanded the Release/Gate board from the legacy 900 px cap to the full available workspace width while retaining responsive criterion columns.
- Opened the actionable v0.6 Scaling & Deterministic Performance TODO milestone after closing the reviewed v0.5 gate.
- Prepared regeneration of the canonical test/source freeze and CI-bound gate snapshot so the dashboard reports current verification rather than stale historical artifacts.

## 2026-09-08 — Cross-platform gate and browser contract repair

- Pinned manifest-backed publication citation, TeX and checksum artifacts to LF so Windows `core.autocrlf` checkouts preserve their recorded bytes.
- Made file-rendering tests byte-exact and rejected POSIX absolute manifest paths with the same unsafe-path contract as traversal attempts.
- Normalized CRLF Markdown in the shared browser renderer and made inventory E2E fixtures override canonical host-detected endpoints.
- Revalidated the affected Python contracts and the full Chromium dashboard suite.

## 2026-09-07 — Natural-language read-aloud

- Added shared German speech controls with start, pause, resume and stop behavior.
- Enabled read-aloud for file previews, expanded chat file cards and the latest Research Chat answer.
- Cleans Markdown links, formatting markers and URLs before speech synthesis.

## 2026-09-07 — BibTeX year column layout

- Reserved a stable, tabular-numeric year column in both BibTeX table previews so four-digit years remain readable.

## 2026-09-07 — Research Catalog facets and current report lifecycle

- Exposed backend-owned domain, status, evidence-status and experiment-progress facet options through the workflow catalog API.
- Added automatic main-branch regeneration of current research reports after canonical registry changes.
- Kept regeneration scoped to `research/generated`; historical experiment-owned reports are never rewritten.

## 2026-09-07 — DOCX viewer surface alignment

- Removed the white nested DOCX popup/card from the file viewer.
- Aligned DOCX headings, links, tables, lists and images with the dashboard base CSS and responsive viewer width.

- Added safe clickable DOI and publication URL links to both BibTeX viewer paths.
- Matched BibTeX links and tables to the dashboard base CSS.
- Fixed Markdown/documentation prose so wrapped source lines render as continuous paragraphs.

## 2026-09-07 — Functional viewer restoration

## 2026-09-07 — Viewer path compatibility

- Fixed preview failures for workflow artifact paths containing Windows backslashes.
- Canonicalized separators in both the shared browser renderer and file-preview API handler.
- Added HTTP regression coverage for encoded Windows-style paths.

## 2026-09-07 — Structured archive and JSON previews

- Added safe, metadata-only previews for ZIP-compatible containers: `.zip`, `.epub`, `.whl`, `.jar` and `.cbz`.
- Added member-count and uncompressed-size limits, plus unsafe archive-path indicators, without extracting archive entries.
- Replaced JSON-only pretty text previews with bounded expandable JSON trees while preserving the exact source for editing and copying.
- Documented remaining media metadata, PDF extraction, legacy Office and local diagram-conversion work.

## 2026-09-07 — File Viewer formats and scientific rendering

- Added explicit preview contracts for Mermaid, Graphviz, PlantUML and LaTeX sources.
- Improved Markdown and notebook rendering for fenced code, MathJax formulas and bounded PNG/JPEG outputs.
- Centralized Mermaid rendering in the shared file renderer with strict security mode and source disclosure fallback.
- Routed relative research-document links through the canonical viewer and removed duplicate BibTeX raw output.
- Documented Graphviz/PlantUML SVG conversion as a remaining local capability rather than using a remote renderer for research content.

## 2026-09-07 — GitHub/Hugging Face mirror synchronization

- Refreshed the project and Hugging Face baseline documentation to the current `main` status.
- Kept GitHub `main` canonical while publishing `HF_README.md` as the Hugging Face repository README.
- Updated the optional mirror workflow to publish a fresh one-commit source snapshot with Git LFS objects, avoiding rejected binary blobs from inherited history.

- Configured the Docker image to start the integrated dashboard on `0.0.0.0:8765`.
- Published the live dashboard as `superdigger/Brain-5D-Space`.
- Added automatic synchronization to the Space repository alongside the model mirror.

## 2026-09-07 — Space API rate-limit handling

- Added shared non-JSON response handling so HTML/429 proxy pages no longer surface as `Unexpected token '<'`.
- Reduced dashboard polling frequency automatically on Hugging Face Space hosts.

## 2026-09-07 — Repository catalog audit CI report

- Added a reproducible repository-wide RQ/H audit report in Markdown and JSON.
- Added explicit reasons for historical/design references and negative-test fixtures; unknown missing identifiers fail CI.
- Excluded generated/build/cache outputs from the primary-source scan so reports remain stable and self-contained.

## 2026-09-07 — RQ-SNN-001 clean-freeze rerun and AIRR retry

- Ran `EXP-SNN-001-R5` from a clean worktree with `dirty=false`, 20 runs, 10 seeds and 100,000 ticks per run.
- Classified the dedicated sustained-activity protocol as `DIRECT_MATCH` while retaining Human Review/EVID gates.
- Added append-only AIRR retry artifacts; local Ollama role failures remain explicitly non-evidence and review-pending.

## 2026-09-07 — Pacing-only determinism proof

- Added regression coverage showing target-Hz versus unlimited configuration produces identical deterministic batch results for equal inputs and `dt`.

## 2026-09-07 — Runtime pacing benchmark

- Added a bounded RuntimeController pacing benchmark for targeted and unlimited modes.
- Persisted target/achieved Hz, realtime ratio, `dt`, tick cost and phase profile in the benchmark output.

## 2026-09-07 — Hard protection and ordering gates

- Added hard safety trips for thermal, fan and persistence failures.
- Verified learned allocation cannot override these trips and protection freezes plasticity before sacrificing safety-critical paths.

## 2026-09-07 — Peripheral adapter mutation boundary coverage

- Added a negative test for non-executing peripheral adapter registration and catalog publication.
- Verified canonical core and research state digests remain unchanged.

## 2026-09-07 — Real-body platform failure-path coverage

- Added coverage for hosts without optional temperature, fan and load-average APIs.
- Verified missing measurements remain `None` or empty instead of receiving fallback values.

## 2026-09-07 — Live telemetry propagation coverage

## 2026-09-07 — Failed experiment retries repaired

- Added `REPLICATION` as a valid scientific run mode for frozen replication protocols.
- Isolated transient neuron/event reset to the learning-interference protocol so independent tasks start from a clean dynamic state without discarding learned weights.
- Re-ran both failed protocols successfully: `EXP-REPL-0001-R1` and `EXP-LIFE-0001-R1`.

## 2026-09-06 — Registry-driven sequential workflow

- Batch execution now follows the protocol registry instead of one global seed/tick setting.
- All catalog experiments are preselected with their required parameters; users can deselect entries before starting.
- Exploratory experiments use explicit automatic Runtime-Ticks defaults.

## 2026-09-06 — Batch result visibility

- Fixed the batch dialog so successful runs close after rendering workflow/report results.
- Added visible running state and persistent error/result output instead of silently generating files.
- Connected batch progress and completion to the Footer experiment/test-run status.

## 2026-09-06 — Exploratory experiment artifacts

- Exploratory runs now appear as complete experiments with data and summary artifacts instead of only creating loose files.
- Batch result entries now link each exploratory child summary and identify the run as a test run.

## 2026-09-06 — Batch execution options and exploratory start

- Fixed batch start by removing the unconditional Runtime Bridge requirement for operational protocol batches.
- Added independent seeds/ticks per selected protocol.
- Exploratory questions can now be selected and started through bounded Runtime-Ticks execution.

## 2026-09-06 — Exploratory workflow execution

- Exploratory questions are no longer greyed out or hidden in the batch workflow.
- They can run through the bounded Runtime-Ticks path and are explicitly recorded as exploratory.
- Operational protocol execution remains unchanged and scientific evidence promotion stays blocked for exploratory runs.

## 2026-09-06 — Experiment workflow selection repair

- Fixed the batch selection so all 48 Research Catalog questions are visible.
- Marked questions without an operational protocol as exploratory and non-runnable instead of hiding them.
- Improved visible batch dialog status and result handling.

## 2026-09-06 — Experiment workflow UI activation

- Fixed the unavailable Experiment-Workflow action in Research.
- Wired protocol selection, popup options, start/cancel behavior and aggregate report output to the existing batch endpoint.

## 2026-09-06 — EXP-GEN-0033 replication

- Registered frozen `sustained_activity_stability_v1` / `PREREG-SNN-001` for `RQ-SNN-001` and `H-SNN-001-A`.
- Added a dedicated long-horizon runner with full spike-per-tick traces, 1,000-tick windows, 10,000-tick burn-in, control/treatment arms and deterministic stability thresholds.
- Executed `EXP-SNN-001-R2`: 20 runs, 10 seeds, 100,000 ticks each, 0 runtime errors, 20/20 stability passes.
- Scientific evidence promotion remains blocked by dirty-tree provenance and required human review; no hypothesis status was auto-promoted.

## 2026-09-06 — Live experiment footer status

- Added live experiment ID, running/completed state and progress text to the Footer.
- Protected active workflow information from normal dashboard status refreshes.

## 2026-09-06 — Runtime & Wesen grid readability

- Reworked Runtime & Wesen into explicit rows and columns for the body map, sidebars and technical interface.
- Made the Embodied Multi-Network Interface full-width and responsive so its labels and status values remain readable.

## 2026-09-06 — Full-page tabs and responsive box states

- Added a shared box-state controller for minimize, standard and maximize actions.
- Maximized panels use a full-page overlay; minimized panels retain their header and hide only their content.
- Added responsive workspace minimum heights and Escape-to-standard behavior.

## 2026-09-06 — Restored Wissenschaft Network route

- Fixed the `Neuronales Netzwerk` route under `Wissenschaft`.
- Re-enabled Network subview tabs while preserving exclusive `hidden` panel switching.

## 2026-09-06 — Fixed application header and primary areas

- Fixed the Header and the three-area primary navigation as one top application chrome.
- Added runtime height measurement so wrapped tablet/mobile navigation does not cover workspace content.

- Unified Footer Runtime, I/O, experiment, mode, health and live-vital regions into one responsive grid.
- Added visible Runtime tick and command feedback targets required by the Footer controller.
- Moved Settings/Release actions into Health and removed the duplicate injected Release row.

## 2026-09-06 — Dashboard CSS consolidation pass II

- Removed the legacy unscoped white Topbar override and restored coordinated dark/light shell theming.
- Removed redundant Experience utility, ribbon and welcome surfaces from the default Overview composition.
- Replaced remaining fixed workbench heights with responsive viewport guardrails.
- Fixed `embodiment-self-model.js` initialization order for unavailable connection rendering.

## 2026-09-06 — Canonical dashboard CSS and accessibility

- Consolidated the dashboard CSS entry path through `styles.css`, including shell, Experience, operator, Embodiment and Wesen layers, and removed duplicate dynamic stylesheet loading.
- Added a shared responsive surface system for 4K, 1080p, tablet and mobile with semantic green/orange/red status states, visible focus rings, contrast mode and reduced-motion support.
- Added a persisted Reader view, full-size modal sizing and tab/`hidden` rules that reduce nested scrollbars without clipping workspace content.
- Restored early Wesen timeline creation so the morphology history control remains visible before the first observed frame.

## 2026-09-06 — Footer 6/3 grid alignment

- Rebalanced the Footer into six equal upper columns and three equal lower telemetry columns.
- Unified symbol dimensions and Footer typography for consistent spacing.

## 2026-09-06 — Compact Footer controls

- Reduced Footer icon buttons, labels, metrics and internal spacing for clearer 1080p/100% alignment.
- Preserved accessible titles and click targets on all Runtime controls.

## 2026-09-06 — Fixed 1080p application shell

- Header and primary menu are pinned above the display area.
- Only the middle `main` area scrolls; the Footer stays visible below it.
- The shell is tuned for 1920×1080 at 100% without reintroducing fixed tab heights.

## 2026-09-06 — Responsive viewport and footer flow

- Removed the fixed `calc(100vh - 241px)` active-tab height and nested scroll container.
- Footer visibility no longer depends on 1080p at 67% zoom; workspaces use the complete document flow.
- Added horizontal overflow protection to the current Experience shell.

## 2026-09-06 — Frontend shell consolidation

- Prevented the initial frontend flash between legacy tabs and the current three-area navigation.
- Removed duplicate dynamically appended Footer controls and kept one static Runtime control surface.
- Consolidated Footer CSS into the Experience shell and removed the MAX batch-yield note.

## 2026-09-06 — Header and footer shell stabilization

- Header sizing, status-cluster placement and responsive control wrapping are stabilized.
- Footer Start/Pause/Stop controls and live input/output fields are restored in the current DOM.
- Conflicting fixed Footer layout rules are replaced by a responsive two-row shell.

## 2026-09-05 — Experiment Runner inputs and conditions

- Der Dashboard-Runner akzeptiert einzelne Seeds, CSV-Listen und Bereiche wie
  `0-29`; Seeds werden validiert, dedupliziert und in Workflow/Manifest/Report
  persistiert.
- PING-, 5D- und TIME-Läufe verwenden das eingestellte Tick-Budget tatsächlich;
  die bisherigen widersprüchlichen festen Messdauern entfallen.
- Protokollspezifische Voreinstellungen und Bedingungsvorlagen für Standard-,
  Replikations-, Sensitivitäts-, Pilot- und Kurzläufe wurden ergänzt.
- Laufende Tests zeigen nun einen animierten Fortschrittsbalken; der Footer zeigt
  während separater Science-Läufe `Testlauf` statt fälschlich leerer Runtime-
  Aktivität und lädt danach wieder echte Telemetrie.
- `science_all_v1` bündelt PING, Temporal, STDP, Learning, TIME, 5D und
  Regulation in einem gemeinsamen, gruppiert dokumentierten DATA-/Manifest-Lauf.
- Network-Impulse-DATA enthält nun die beobachtete Spike-Sequenz, einen
  Sequenz-Digest und den transparenten Reproduzierbarkeitsvergleich über Seeds.

## 2026-09-05 — EXP-GEN-0007 Provenance and impulse response repair

- Die kontrollierte Network-Impulse-Probe überträgt Impulse nun mit einem
  explizit registrierten Synapsen-Gain; Synapsen respektieren dabei ihre
  konfigurierte obere Gewichtsgrenze.
- Science-Suite-Manifeste enthalten echte Konfigurations-, Code- und DATA-Digests.
- Der Research Assistant liest experiment-lokale `DATA`- und Workflow-Artefakte
  korrekt und markiert die vorhandenen Runs nicht mehr als fehlende Daten.

## 2026-09-05 — Research Experiment Runner IDs

- Science-Runner werden jetzt durch das gewählte Protokoll bestimmt; automatische
  und manuelle `EXP-*`-IDs bleiben frei waehlbare, traceable Labels.
- Der Dashboard-Runner ueberschreibt automatische IDs nicht mehr mit bereits
  publizierten Vorlagen-IDs.
- Der registrierte STDP-Pair-Timing-Pfad akzeptiert ebenfalls generierte und
  manuelle IDs und schreibt diese konsistent in DATA, Manifest und Report.
- Die Ergebnisanzeige verarbeitet nun sowohl Tick-Läufe als auch Science-Suite-
  Antworten mit Run-Anzahl und Dauer.

## 2026-09-04 — Gate-Evidence aktualisiert

- Lokale Vollsuite und Determinismus-Evidence fuer den aktuellen Tree erneuert:
  **682 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed**; Scientific Gate ist `passed`.
- Black lokal fuer `runtime.py` und `server.py` korrigiert.
- GitHub Continuous Integration #307 war fuer den damaligen Tree in Black und
  Pyright fehlgeschlagen. Nach den lokalen Korrekturen steht ein erfolgreicher
  CI-Lauf fuer den aktuellen Tree noch aus; Release Readiness bleibt bis dahin
  `not_ready`.

## 2026-09-03 — Release-Gate Übersicht und Re-Check

- Gate A, B und C werden vollständig in einer responsiven Release-Ansicht
  dargestellt, einschließlich aller Kriterien und Live-Runtime-Werte.
- Der manuelle Re-Check nutzt nun denselben zentralen State Store wie das
  Polling und zeigt während der Prüfung einen deaktivierten Button.
- Die Evidenzanzeige bleibt fail-closed: lokale Tests, externe CI und
  wissenschaftliche Nachweise werden getrennt und mit ihrem echten Status gezeigt.
- Jedes Gate-Kriterium öffnet per Klick oder Tastatur einen Detaildialog mit
  dem konkreten Grund, der Quelle und vorhandener Evidence.

## 2026-09-03 — Runtime Clock und Tick-Profiling

- Runtime Controller unterstützt `target_hz` und explizites `MAX`, ohne das
  wissenschaftliche `dt = 1 ms` zu verändern.
- Telemetrie meldet Achieved Hz, Simulationsgeschwindigkeit relativ zu Echtzeit,
  Tick-Latenz, Jitter, Compute-Limit-Status und grobe Phasenzeiten.
- Operator- und Embodiment-APIs veröffentlichen diese Werte als `runtime_clock`;
  der visuelle Regler ist gegen Polling-Rennen gehärtet.
- Das Phasenprofil erfasst nun vollständige Tick-Segmente inklusive Pre-/Post-Hooks,
  Netzwerk-Schritt und Homeostasis; `NeuralNetwork.step_batch(n)` führt dieselben
  deterministischen Tick-Semantiken aus und wird gegen Einzel-Ticks geprüft.

## 2026-09-03 — Artefakt-Reviews und Experimentdatum

- Menschliche Reviews koennen nun an beliebige Dateien innerhalb eines
  Experimentordners angehaengt werden; Reviewstatus, Reviewer, Kommentar und
  Inhaltsdigest werden append-only als `.review.json` gespeichert.
- Neue Experimente erhalten `created_at` in UTC und werden in der Research-API
  nach diesem Datum absteigend ausgegeben.

## 2026-09-03 — Ausfuehrliche deutsche Experimentzusammenfassungen

- `summary.md` enthaelt nun Versuchsmetadaten, Laufanzahl, Status, AI-Konfidenz,
  angeforderte Nachweise und empfohlene Folgeexperimente.
- Relative Markdown-Links in der Dashboard-Dateiansicht oeffnen Dateien im
  bestehenden Viewer; externe Links bleiben externe Browser-Links.

## 2026-09-03 — 5D dimensionality experiment v3

- Executed `EXP-5D-0001-v3` through the dashboard with 15 empirical DATA rows.
- Verified experiment-local manifest, report, summary, AIRR, and three AIAR role reports.
- The measured result was a zero-activity null finding across all five conditions; no scientific evidence was released.

## 2026-09-03 — Learning report recovery

- Regenerated the missing AIRR and AIAR outputs for `EXP-LEARN-20260903-2330`.
- Updated its experiment-local `summary.md` with all stored artifacts and the post-hoc assessment.
- Ollama confidence values are normalized conservatively when a local model returns them as invalid text.

## 2026-09-03 — Ten-seed learning loop replication

- Published `EXP-LEARN-20260903-2330` through the Dashboard workflow with
  seeds 42 through 51.
- All 10 baseline probes lacked a target spike; all 10 trained probes produced
  one. The mean synaptic-weight delta was `0.7788007831`.
- Generated DATA, manifest, workflow, report and post-run summary; EVID remains
  gated by clean freeze and independent review.

## 2026-09-03 — Automatic experiment summaries

- Every completed dashboard experiment now creates `summary.md` in its own experiment directory.
- The internal post-hoc assistant summary links DATA, manifests, workflows, technical reports, AIRR, and AIAR artifacts without changing the causal experiment path.

## 2026-09-03 — 5D dimensionality experiment v2

- Executed `EXP-5D-0001-v2` for `RQ-5D-001` / `H-5D-001-A` with 15 controlled runs.
- Stored DATA, AIRR, and AIAR outputs in the experiment-owned directory.

## 2026-09-03 — Experiment-owned AI reports

- AIRR and AIAR reports are now stored below the owning experiment directory.
- Dashboard report paths explicitly include the experiment ID; legacy global
  AIRR reports remain readable for compatibility.

## 2026-09-03 — PING v3 experiment run

- Published the registered `EXP-PING-0001-v3` run with 12 DATA records,
  manifest, workflow and technical report.
- Persisted the post-hoc AIRR JSON/Markdown report and all three AIAR role
  records; human review remains pending and scientific evidence remains false.

## 2026-09-03 — Productive STDP and learning repeat DATA runs

- Published `EXP-STDP-0002` through the Dashboard workflow with three
  independent seeds and reproducible positive synaptic-weight changes.
- Published versioned learning repeat `EXP-LEARN-20260903-2300` without
  overwriting `EXP-EMB-0001`; all three seeds changed from no baseline target
  spike to a trained target spike after 20 reward updates.
- EVID remains gated by clean freeze and independent review; BODY, MEM and
  Azure-backed AIRR experiments remain open.

## 2026-09-03 — Release hygiene baseline

- Applied Black formatting across the CI scope (`src`, `tests`, `scripts`).
- Verified the local baseline at **675 passed, 5 skipped**, with Black, Ruff and
  Mypy clean.

## 2026-09-03 — Versioned PING experiment

- Preserved the existing `EXP-PING-0001` run as v1 and added
  `EXP-PING-0001-v2` instead of overwriting its artifacts.
- Published 12 Dashboard DATA runs as six identical replica pairs across three
  seeds and two recurrence treatments.
- Verified identical initial state digests and response signatures per pair;
  EVID remains gated by clean freeze and independent review.

## 2026-09-03 — Complete science experiment artifact publication

- Science-suite runs now publish and register `DATA/runs.json`, `workflow.json`
  and `report.md` in the experiment manifest.
- The configured AI backend is injected into the workflow and generates the
  post-hoc AIRR JSON/Markdown pair after the completed run; without a backend,
  the result explicitly reports `unavailable`.
- Generated AIRR paths are recorded in the manifest without changing the
  experiment's causal path or scientific-evidence status.

## 2026-09-03 — Type and dashboard runtime hygiene

- Fixed strict typing across AIRR, learning preparation, research chat, Ollama
  metadata and dashboard learning routes.
- Restored the Network workspace markup required by the dashboard renderers and
  workspace-view navigation.
- Verified `673 passed, 5 skipped`, clean Ruff and Mypy checks, and a successful
  package build.

## 2026-09-03 — Learning partition leakage guard

- Added fail-closed validation for digest overlap across train, validation and
  holdout learning partitions.
- Added explicit rejection of registered AI- and gold-label digests in holdout
  data before a preparation proposal can be persisted.
- Added regression coverage for cross-partition overlap and holdout labels.

## 2026-09-03 — Learning source provenance derivation

- Added typed `LearningSourceRef` derivation from validated `KnowledgeItem`
  provenance and immutable environment-capture mappings.
- Preserved source digest, origin, trust and explicit train/validation/holdout
  partition metadata; incomplete captures fail closed.
- Added regression coverage for both derivation paths.

## 2026-09-03 — Persistent Learning Preparation API

- Persisted proposal and approved `PreparedLearningPlan` artifacts with typed
  deserialization, revision metadata and separate approval storage.
- Added guarded `GET`/`POST /api/learning/preparation` operations for create,
  approve and list without granting runtime authority to proposals.
- Added persistence and HTTP route regression coverage.

## 2026-09-03 — Post-experiment AI research report

- Dashboard experiment completion now appends the existing AIRR JSON/Markdown
  report after DATA, Manifest and technical report publication.
- AIRR generation is post-hoc and cannot affect the experiment causal path.
- Missing or failing AI backends are returned as explicit report status while
  the completed experiment remains completed; human review and Evidence remain open.
- Human review now requires an existing review-pending AIRR, a non-empty reviewer
  identity and comments; the append-only review records the report digest and
  never grants `scientific_evidence`.

## 2026-09-03 — Full-stack Learning Studio run

- Added a bounded AI context-length control to Learning Preparation requests.
- Added a separate, explicit `/api/learning/run` operator action that invokes
  only the registered LearningEngine workflow and persists DATA/Manifest/Report.
- Kept AI preparation proposal-only; missing operator confirmation fails closed.
- Added route and UI regression coverage for the execution boundary.

## 2026-09-03 — Learning preparation reset

- The non-executing Learning Preparation Studio now resets all preparation
  inputs together with the proposal state.
- Added regression coverage for the complete preparation form wiring.

## 2026-09-03 — Regulation experiment runner

- Added deterministic `EXP-REG-0001` runs for nominal, chronic-pressure and
  unknown telemetry conditions.
- Recorded bounded drives, regulatory state and functional state without
  inferring missing signals or making consciousness claims.
- Exposed the runner through the guarded dashboard science workflow.

## 2026-09-03 — Restore determinism verification

- Verified uninterrupted, in-process restore, and fresh-process restore paths
  against one canonical digest.
- Confirmed equality for runtime counters, neuron state, synapse weights and
  eligibility, homeostasis, learning traces, pending rewards, and journal
  restore in `research/generated/verification/restore_determinism.json`.

## 2026-09-03 — Multi-actuator routing

- Added typed `ActuatorHub`/`ActionRouter` routing by stable actuator ID.
- Each registered actuator retains its own authorization, capability, safety,
  rate-limit, receipt and hash-linked audit boundary.
- Unknown actuator IDs fail closed without invoking an adapter.

## 2026-09-03 — TIME and 5D Dashboard science protocols

- Added registered Dashboard protocols for TIME tick-ladder calibration and 5D
  dimensional ablation.
- Published `EXP-TIME-0001` with 15 DATA runs through 1,000,000 ticks and
  `EXP-5D-0001` with 150 DATA runs across five conditions and 30 seeds each.
- Kept EVID generation gated by clean-freeze and independent review.

## 2026-09-03 — Dashboard tab selection consistency

- Unified static and dynamically created dashboard tabs behind one delegated
  navigator so exactly one tab page remains active after every selection.
- Removed the duplicate Learning Studio click handler and added a regression
  test for dynamic-tab switching.

## 2026-09-03 — Deterministic task outcome verification

- Added typed `TaskOutcome` and `TaskOutcomeVerifier` contracts that derive
  task success from observed terminal environment state.
- Routed experience rewards through the verifier; decoder output and supplied
  reward values cannot independently create task success.
- Missing environment observations remain explicitly unknown and unrewarded.

## 2026-09-03 — Action receipts

- Added typed receipts for controlled embodiment actions with deterministic
  command IDs, lifecycle state, latency, errors, safety clamp and effect status.
- Acceptance is explicitly distinct from observed environment feedback.
- Hash-linked audit records can be persisted as JSONL and verified after reopen;
  `StorageLayout` exposes the operator action-journal path.

## 2026-09-03 — Structural pressure hysteresis

- Added per-mechanism release hysteresis to self-organization proposals.
- Repeated proposals now require pressure to leave the dead-band first, or a
  deterministic re-arm interval to elapse during sustained pressure;
  capacity limits do not create hidden latches.

## 2026-09-03 — Deterministic morphology ledger

- Added typed neuron/synapse birth-tick tracking and deterministic age queries.
- Added structural cost accounting with independent growth and pruning budgets;
  budget overruns fail closed.

## 2026-09-03 — Functional regulation qualities

- Added deterministic bounded `FunctionalState` values for safety, activation,
  valence and uncertainty.
- Missing observations remain unknown; the values are technical regulation
  outputs and are not evidence of emotion, self-reflection or consciousness.

## 2026-09-03 — Deterministic regulatory state

- Added bounded internal regulation variables derived from interoception:
  thermal margin, energy reserve, continuity risk, sensory integrity, resource
  pressure and optional task progress.
- Missing source signals remain `None` with explicit uncertainty; values are
  not interpreted as emotions or evidence of self-reflection.

## 2026-09-03 — Impulse response and temporal comparison foundations

- Added bounded `NetworkImpulseProbe` and serializable `NetworkResponseSignature`
  for observable single-impulse measurements.
- Added `TemporalStateMemory` and `TemporalComparator` with FAST/MEDIUM/SLOW
  horizons; references are retained without rewinding runtime state.
- Registered `EXP-PING-0001` and `EXP-TEMP-0001` as pending scientific runs;
  recurrence and self-reflection claims remain intentionally unproven.

## 2026-09-03 — Dashboard anatomy and footer telemetry

- Added Research focus entries for Alpha.8, recursive causal loopbacks and the
  functional self-model documents.
- Applied the Embodiment visual language to shared dashboard surfaces.
- Removed the Network workspace and its navigation/deep links from the dashboard.
- Added compact footer bars for measured activity, spikes and resource pressure;
  unavailable resource telemetry remains explicitly unavailable.

## 2026-09-03 — Alpha.8 digital interoception foundation

- Added typed `VitalSignal` and `InteroceptionFrame` contracts for system-state
  sensing, including quality, safety ranges and explicit unknown values.
- Added deterministic normalization and `SystemSensorAdapter.sample_interoception()`
  without changing the existing `SensorFrame` provider contract.
- Added bounded deterministic drives for thermal threat, resource pressure and
  continuity risk; unavailable task, novelty and actuator signals remain explicit
  `None` values with uncertainty rather than being inferred.
- Extended the opt-in host sensor with RAM reserve, free storage, disk/network
  I/O, battery and fan telemetry; unsupported hardware remains `None`.

## 2026-09-03 — Documentation and research status synchronization

- README, Forschungs-README und Roadmaps synchronisieren den verifizierten
  Repository-Stand auf `main` / `b8d5025`.
- Die lokale Regression ist mit `618 passed, 5 skipped` dokumentiert; veraltete
  `379 passing`-Angaben wurden entfernt.
- Technische Implementierung, externe CI und wissenschaftliche EVID werden nun
  ausdrücklich getrennt ausgewiesen. Alpha.7.1 ist der aktuelle Engineering-
  Fokus; unabhängige STDP-/Embodiment-Nachweise und Performancevergleiche
  bleiben offen.

## 2026-09-03 — Controlled storage layout

- Ein zentraler `StorageLayout`-Vertrag kapselt Operator-State, Journals,
  Checkpoints, Experimentpfade (`state/`, `DATA/`, `EVID/`) und ausschließlich
  disposable Dev-Artefakte.
- Scope-Übergänge werden fail-closed begrenzt: DEV darf nicht nach OPERATOR,
  Experimente dürfen nicht gemergt werden, und OPERATOR liefert Experimente
  nur per Snapshot oder Fork.
- Der Runtime-Test vergleicht nun die vollständigen Delta-Payloads von
  `full_change_scan` und `dirty_tracking` bei identischen Eingaben.

## 2026-09-03 — Dashboard research operation status

- Experimentlisten zeigen nun neben der technischen AI-Betriebsart den
  wissenschaftlichen Status `PURE EXPERIMENT`, `AI OBSERVING`, `AI PROPOSING`
  oder `AI CAUSALLY ACTIVE`; unvollständige Manifeste bleiben `UNKNOWN`.

## 2026-09-03 — Causal attribution reports

- AI-Exposure, Causal-Taint, Interaktionsrollen, Treatments sowie Twin- und
  Ablation-Referenzen werden nun deterministisch als nicht-evidenter
  `CausalAttributionReport` aus dem Experimentmanifest erzeugt.

## 2026-09-03 — Epistemic provenance graph

- Digest-only-Knoten und gerichtete, azyklische Kanten verbinden nun Claims,
  Quellen, Experimente und Derived Values mit explizitem `knowledge_origin`.
- Unbekannte Referenzen, doppelte Knoten, Selbstkanten und Zyklen werden
  fail-closed abgewiesen.

## 2026-09-03 — Version bump contract in CI

- Der Scientific Integrity Gate validiert nun positive Versionen und
  nichtleere Änderungsgründe für geänderte Prompt-, Modell-, Treatment- und
  Statistikkomponenten in Experimentmanifesten.

## 2026-09-03 — Deterministic statistics boundary

- AIRR-Modelle dürfen keine reservierten quantitativen Ergebnisfelder mehr
  erzeugen. Quantitative Reports werden ausschließlich aus validierten
  `deterministic_statistics_engine`-Artefakten aufgebaut; Modellantworten
  bleiben auf Beobachtung und Interpretation begrenzt.

## 2026-09-03 — Scientific Integrity Gate

- CI führt nun einen blockierenden Integritätsjob für Determinismus, Restore,
  Canonical State, Golden Chain, Registry-Schema, AI-Leakage und AI-Authority
  aus.

## 2026-09-03 — Knowledge origin contract

- `knowledge_origin` ist als vollständige, getestete Enum mit den neun
  zulässigen Provenienzklassen standardisiert.

## 2026-09-03 — Dashboard AI operation classification

- Research-Experimente zeigen nun read-only, ob AI als `REPLAY`,
  `LIVE_FROZEN_MODEL` oder `LIVE_EXTERNAL_API` betrieben wurde; unvollständige
  Protokolle bleiben als `UNKNOWN` sichtbar.

## 2026-09-03 — Explicit retrieval provenance

- Research-Chat-Antworten tragen nun einen versionierten `RetrievalRecord` mit
  Aktivierung, Quellenanzahl, Snapshot-Digest, NetworkMode und Knowledge Origin.
- Repository-Kontext wird als `FROZEN_CORPUS`, externe Webquellen werden als
  `LIVE_NETWORK` sichtbar protokolliert und bleiben von Evidence getrennt.

## 2026-09-03 — P1 AI governance contracts

- Eingefrorene Prompt-Dateien unter `research/prompts/` werden per
  Protocol-Digest geladen und gegen Änderungen geschützt.
- `PreregistrationLock` sperrt Hypothesen-, Metrik-, Seed- und Analyseinhalte
  nach der Registrierung gegen stille Änderungen.
- AI-Selbstvertrauen wird als `model_self_confidence` separat von empirischer
  Kalibrierung und Brier/ECE-Metriken protokolliert.
- Der `CognitiveAdvisor` erzeugt ausschließlich typisierte, nicht-ausführende
  `ActionProposal`-Contracts mit validierter Konfidenz.
- `InterventionGateway` prüft Capability, Policy und Tick-Rate-Limit, führt ein
  append-only Audit und verlangt Human Override; `MemoryWriteGateway` erzeugt
  ausschließlich digest-only, nicht-ausführende Schreibvorschläge.
- Language-Organ-Requests tragen nun explizit das Treatment
  `LINGUISTIC_TRANSPORT` oder `SEMANTIC_AUGMENTATION`.
- Knowledge-Intake-Provenienz speichert Capture-/Processing-Zeit, MIME,
  Quellenversion, Trust-Klassifikation und Extraktionsmethode.
- AI-Interaction-Records unterscheiden nun `LOGICAL_TIME` und `WALL_CLOCK` und
  können den Response-Anwendungstic explizit protokollieren.
- Experiment-Manifeste unterscheiden `EXPLORATORY` und `CONFIRMATORY`, können
  Confirmatory-Locks für Protocol-, Prompt- und Analyse-Digests speichern und
  Retrieval-Provenienz sichtbar registrieren.
- Die Authority-Matrix enthält nun formale Rollen `AI-0` bis `AI-3` mit
  explizit begrenzten Capabilities.
- Das AI-Forschungsobjekt unterstützt nun identische ResearchPackets für
  Multi-Model-Vergleiche, Disagreement-/Agreement-Messung ohne Evidence-Status,
  Blindlabels, Reviewer-Raten, AIR-Fragen und Interpretations-Fingerprints.
- Data-Partition-Governance prüft nun Digest-Überschneidungen und verhindert
  AI-/Gold-Label-Digests im Scientific-Holdout.
- Die Borrowed Intelligence Ratio ist nun an eine Protocol-ID gebunden und
  wird explizit als Nicht-Evidence markiert.
- Experiment-Manifeste registrieren nun den Netzwerkmodus; Live Network wird
  für Scientific Runs fail-closed abgewiesen und Retrieval-Versionen werden
  sichtbar protokolliert.

## 2026-09-03 — Non-executing AI shadow mode

- `ShadowMode` erzeugt digest-basierte Observation-, Interpretation- und Proposal-Contracts.
- Vorschläge werden explizit mit `executed: false` markiert und besitzen keinen Apply-/Execute-Pfad.
- Die Firewall erlaubt `propose` ausschließlich für `PROPOSAL_ONLY`; quantitative Proposal-Evaluation bleibt separat.
- `evaluate_shadow_proposals` berechnet deterministisch Precision, Recall, False-Positive-Rate, Accuracy, Brier Score, ECE und Utility.
- Experimentmanifeste können gemeinsame Twin-Run-Eingaben mit Snapshot-, Input-,
  Reward- und Tickplan-Digest sowie getrennten AI-off/AI-on-IDs registrieren;
  die tatsächliche Ausführung bleibt ein offener Forschungsschritt.
- Abgeschlossene AI-off/AI-on-Ergebnisse können nachgelagert ausschließlich per
  Digest am Twin-Run registriert werden; der Vergleich selbst bleibt extern.
- Die sechs Kontrollgruppen `SNN_ONLY`, `LANGUAGE_ORGAN`, `KNOWLEDGE_INTAKE`,
  `LANGUAGE_KNOWLEDGE`, `LLM_ONLY` und `FULL_SYSTEM` sind als validierte,
  nicht-ausführende Experimentvorlagen registrierbar.
- Ollama-Provenienz weist nun explizite Felder für Modell-/Artefakt-Digest,
  Quantisierung, Präzision, Engine, Hardware sowie Tokenizer-, Prompt-,
  Toolset- und Retrieval-Digests aus; nicht gelieferte Providerdaten bleiben

- Twin Runs können nun denselben Runner mit identischem Seed, Input, Reward und
  Tickplan für AI-off und AI-on ausführen und beide Ergebnis-Digests registrieren.
- AI-Protokollversion und Bump-Grund werden im Experimentmanifest validiert.

## 2026-09-03 — Language Organ sham controls

- Deterministisches `RandomLanguageOrgan` als pseudozufällige Kontrollbedingung ergänzt.
- Digest-adressiertes `ReplayLanguageOrgan` ohne Live-Fallback ergänzt.
- Beide Kontrollen erfüllen den read-only `LanguageModelBackend`-Vertrag; fehlende Replay-Daten schlagen kontrolliert fehl.

## 2026-09-03 — Registered AI reproducibility levels

- Experimentmanifeste enthalten nun standardmäßig `ai_reproducibility: R0`.
- `R0` bis `R3` sind als strikt validierte Klassifikation für AI-Beteiligung registrierbar.
- Die Registrierung behauptet noch keine Twin-Run- oder Kontrollgruppen-Reproduzierbarkeit; diese Nachweise bleiben separate TODOs.

## 2026-09-03 — Validated observation replay stream

- `ObservationStream` erzeugt append-only `observation_stream.jsonl` mit Sequenz, Tick und Payload-Digest.
- Beim Laden werden JSON-Struktur, Reihenfolge, monotone Ticks und Digest-Integrität fail-closed validiert.
- Ungültige oder manipulierte Beobachtungen werden vor einem Offline-Replay abgewiesen.

## 2026-09-03 — Frozen AI replay backend

- Verfügbare Laufzeitmetriken wie Lade- und Gesamtdauer werden ohne erfundene Werte übernommen.
- Echte Modellartefakt-, Quantisierungs-, Engine- und Hardware-Digests benötigen noch einen expliziten Provider-Manifestpfad.

## 2026-09-03 — Causal card and AI evidence gate

- Experimentmanifeste erzeugen eine Causal Card mit Interaktions-IDs, Rollen und wissenschaftlicher Klassifikation.
- AI-influenced Läufe benötigen vor Evidence-Erzeugung ein registriertes `ai_treatment` mit `protocol_id`.
- Pure SNN-Läufe bleiben rückwärtskompatibel; fehlende AI-Metadaten werden als `PURE` behandelt.

## 2026-09-03 — AI interaction persistence and causal taint

- Experimentmanifeste speichern AI-Interaktionen append-only mit Digest-Provenienz.
- `causal_taint` wird von `PURE` über `OBSERVED` und `PROPOSED` bis `AI_INFLUENCED` monoton aggregiert.
- Interaktionen fremder Experimente werden abgewiesen.

## 2026-09-03 — AI exposure in experiment manifests

- Experimentmanifeste enthalten standardmäßig `ai_exposure: none`.
- `ExperimentRecorder.record_ai_exposure()` validiert und speichert die kontrollierten Exposure-Stufen.
- Ungültige oder uneingeschränkte Exposure-Werte werden fail-closed abgewiesen.

## 2026-09-03 — AI import boundary contract test

- Struktureller AST-Test ergänzt, der direkte Imports von `src.core` und `src.main` aus Research-Assistant- und Language-Organ-Paketen verhindert.
- Der Test meldet konkrete Datei- und Modulverletzungen und läuft fail-closed.

## 2026-09-03 — Scientific authority matrix

- Maschinenlesbare Authority-Matrix für SNN, Statistics Engine, Language Organ, Research Assistant, Cognitive Advisor, Action Gateway, Evidence Engine und Human Reviewer ergänzt.
- AI-Rollen sind read-only oder proposal-only; unbekannte Rollen werden fail-closed abgewiesen.

## 2026-09-03 — Scientific AI read-only firewall

- Der Research-Chat erzwingt vor jeder Interpretation eine explizite Read-only-Autorität.
- Mutierende oder unbekannte AI-Aktionen werden durch `ScientificAIFirewall` abgewiesen.
- Die Firewall-Ausweitung auf alle Laufzeit- und Speichergrenzen bleibt offen.

## 2026-09-03 — Scientific AI contract records

- Verträge speichern nur Payload-Digests und Metadaten; sie stellen keine Ausführungsmethode bereit.
- Die strukturelle Firewall und Authority-Matrix bleiben als nächste P0-Schritte offen.

## 2026-09-03 — Ollama provenance baseline

- Ollama-Chatantworten protokollieren nun Samplingparameter, Stop-Sequenzen, Timeout und einen Response-Digest.

- Ollama-Modelle werden entdeckt; Microsoft Copilot ist als OAuth-abhängige, derzeit nicht konfigurierte Option ausgewiesen.

## 2026-09-05 — Evidence, documentation and storage validation

- Hardened the evidence gate so only completed manifests with explicit,
  consistent validity counters and registered AI-treatment modes can produce
  scientific evidence.
- Added regression coverage for incomplete provenance, inconsistent runtime
  counters, unknown lifecycle states and unknown dashboard API routes.
- Added a dependency-free documentation checker for local Markdown links,
  canonical version claims and the collected pytest baseline.
- Added scheduled/manual CI coverage for the opt-in large `.b5d` and journal
  storage tests with archived JUnit results.
- Refreshed the verified suite baseline to 716 collected, 711 passed and 5
  skipped tests.
- Extended `EXP-EMB-0001` DATA records with separate action-acceptance and
  observed-effect receipts.
- Added deterministic actuator-failure and sensor-loss control conditions;
  rejected actions and sensor runtime errors remain visible in DATA.
- Added a pre-registered replay/open-loop action condition with an explicit
  action source in each DATA record.
- Independent protocol runs now use distinct deterministic seeds and persist
  per-seed target and runtime-error metrics for stability comparison.
- EXP-EMB-0001 manifests now bind protocol code, configuration, prompt
  applicability and DATA through validated SHA-256 provenance digests.
- Productive-learning repeats now include matched learning-off and sham-replay
  controls, preserving pre/post behavior, reward and weight metrics per seed.
- `PROTOCOL-STDP-0002` is now explicit in the canonical YAML configuration and
  rejects overlapping or incomplete train/validation/holdout trial partitions.
- Added clean-process productive-learning publication with code/config/prompt/
  DATA digests, plus a guarded DATA-to-EVID promotion path requiring human
  review and a matching source freeze.

## 2026-09-03 — AI Research Reports (AIRR)

- Added `PROTOCOL-AIRR-001`, the AIRR schema, and an Analyst -> Critical Reviewer -> Writer pipeline.
- AIRR JSON is canonical; Markdown is rendered deterministically and linked by digests.
- Reports are permanently marked as AI-generated interpretation, never scientific evidence.
- Added full ResearchPacket and DATA/EVID provenance, deterministic statistics support, and append-only human reviews.
- Exposed AIRR reports through the Research dashboard without granting AI execution or evidence authority.
- Added a Research Self-Knowledge Chat grounded in repository Research and Docs; free text cannot execute experiments.
- Registered experiment execution remains a separate, structured workflow action with existing validation boundaries.

## 2026-09-03 — Roadmap and TODO separation

- Reorganized the canonical roadmap around Alpha.7 through v1.0 instead of feature accumulation.
- Split actionable work into ENGINEERING, SCIENCE and OPERATION tracks.
- Added `docs/08-roadmap/RESEARCH_ROADMAP.md` with research questions, experiment order and evidence criteria.

## 2026-09-03 — Productive learning path verified locally

- The existing learning experiment now has focused regression coverage.
- A deterministic run changed mean synaptic weight from `0.05` to `0.8288007831`, applied 960 reward-weight updates, and changed the fresh probe from no target spike to a target spike.
- This is an engineering/protocol result only; `EXP-STDP-0002` DATA is published, while EVID remains gated by clean freeze and independent review.

## 2026-09-03 — Executable science suite foundation

- Added `src/research/experiment_suite.py` for controlled PING, TEMP, productive
  STDP and paired learning Before/After runs using real network APIs.
- Added focused regression tests and temporary DATA export support.
- Novelty, prediction error, memory, timescale, dimensional ablation, regulation
  and sensor-loss claims remain open until their registered mechanisms and
  independent protocols exist.

## 2026-09-03 — Dashboard science execution

- Connected `science_suite_v1` to the Dashboard Experiment Runner.
- Published `EXP-PING-0001` with 6 DATA records and `EXP-TEMP-0001` with 3
  DATA records through the workflow service, including manifests and reports.
- EVID remains blocked until a clean source freeze and independent review.

## 2026-09-03 — EXP-EMB-0001 protocol run

- Added a protocol runner for the deterministic sensor-action-reward boundary experiment.
- Executed 180 DATA runs: 60 authorized, 60 unauthorized and 60 sensor-reproducibility controls.
- Authorized runs reached the target at 100% with 60 environment rewards; unauthorized runs produced no reward; all audits and one-tick hook checks passed with zero runtime errors.
- No EVID artifact was created because the registered evidence policy still requires a clean source freeze and review.

## 2026-09-03 — Complete dirty-state emission

- Structural neuron/synapse changes now emit dirty IDs.
- Direct Homeostasis, STDP and reward-weight mutations now invoke the existing
  dirty callbacks.
- Added regression coverage for topology dirty IDs and retained the full-scan
  fallback until storage hook ordering and final-tick capture are optimized.

## 2026-09-03 — Local quality closure

- Pyright now reports zero errors, warnings or informations for the workspace.
- Added regression coverage for the configured Experience composition and
  tick-level topology dirty IDs.

## 2026-09-02 — Configured Experience composition

- Added `build_experience_subsystem()` for the canonical runtime path.
- Experience activation is explicit and defaults to disabled; supported sensor,
  encoder, decoder and deterministic environment types reject unknown values.
- Added a deterministic system encoder and controlled target actuator wiring;
  this composes existing learning and safety components and claims no evidence.
- Added focused tests for deterministic composition and fail-closed provider
  configuration.

## 2026-09-02 — Ollama language-organ bridge

- Connected `OllamaBackend` to the existing `LanguageModelBackend` contract;
  it can now serve `LanguageOrgan` read-only descriptions and monitoring.
- Ollama receives only serialized immutable request data and returns text data;
  it has no runtime, configuration, mutation, execution or evidence authority.
- Network failures and malformed Ollama responses are returned as failed
  `LanguageResponse` values instead of escaping into the simulation.
- Existing `ResearchAssistant` callable usage remains compatible.

## 2026-09-02 — Executable experiment sweep

- Re-ran the focused determinism, B5D storage, STDP protocol and structural E2E checks: `35 passed, 1 skipped`.
- Ran the complete suite with optional large storage/journal checks enabled: `544 passed, 3 skipped`.
- Completed the maximum current `1000`-tick STDP + homeostasis runtime slice without runtime errors; it recorded 1 direct spike, no secondary recruitment and no output propagation.
- The historical `100000`-tick stability config is not executable with the current loader/runtime contract: its schema is outdated and `RuntimeController.run_ticks()` caps one call at 1000 ticks.
- Alpha.5 test execution passed, but evidence publication remained fail-closed because the development tree is dirty; no new EVID record was claimed.

## 2026-09-02 — Scaling benchmark ladder

- Added `scripts/benchmark_ladder.py` for bounded 5k-to-1M neuron scaling
  runs with recorded platform/provenance data and an explicit non-scientific
  claim marker.
- Added fail-closed validation for both Hugging Face sync secrets.
- Added core dirty-state emission and a storage equality regression test;
  capture policy remains scan-default until all external mutation paths emit.

## 2026-09-02 — Embodiment anatomy visualization

- Reworked the Embodiment view into a meaningful anatomy: sensory inputs at
  the head boundary, the neural state as the central database, inner states
  and regulation below it, and actuators as the changeable extremities.
- Preserved the existing telemetry IDs and responsive ordering; unavailable
  adapter data remains explicitly unavailable.
- Added read-only detail popups for each anatomy group, system source, loop
  adapter and discovered connection, populated only from current dashboard
  snapshot/API fields.
- Extended `EmbodimentMetrics` with the real post-action observation state,
  observation tick and termination flags; audio self-hearing, visual
  reflection and other proprioceptive adapters remain explicitly unimplemented
  until real adapters publish them.
- Added the `MetricAggregator.update_embodiment` handoff and regression coverage
  for observation feedback.
- Added the explicit `EmbodimentPipeline` for SensorFrame -> encoder -> SNN ->
  decoder -> controlled actuator -> EnvironmentObservation feedback, with a
  deterministic full-stack test; physical audio/vision self-feedback remains
  configuration-dependent and is not claimed as implemented.
- Added validated in-element pipeline switches for sensor, encoder, SNN,
  decoder, actuator and feedback stages through `/api/embodiment/pipeline`.
- Connected stage configuration to `EmbodimentPipeline` fail-closed execution
  and redrew `brain5d-being.svg` around a bilateral-symmetric organism with a
  central neural database, paired senses and paired extremities.
- Added visible names and honest hover descriptions for all Embodiment pipeline,
  sensor, actuator and feedback nodes.

## 2026-09-02 — Evidence scope digests

- Added explicit evidence scopes and scope-specific source digests.
- Verification writers now emit scoped provenance for restore determinism,
  structural E2E/live-loop and runtime integration artifacts.
- Restore determinism Path C now runs both C1 and C2 in separate worker
  processes and records their PIDs through a filesystem manifest.
- Extracted structural proposal rendering and actions into
  `structural-proposal-panel.js`; removed tracked diagnostic dumps from `tmp/`.
- Completed the console split: `OperatorConsole` now owns only status, logging
  and lifecycle concerns; proposal actions are exclusively panel-owned.
- Gate artifact validation now prefers matching `scope`/`scope_digest` pairs;
  legacy `tested_tree_digest` artifacts remain supported.

## 2026-09-02 — Orthogonal runtime mode contract

- Added validated `operator` / `experiment` / `dev` state modes and independent `full` / `scientific` / `minimal` / `compute` observability profiles.
- Made storage `capture_policy` explicit while retaining `full_change_scan` as the correctness baseline; dirty tracking is not enabled before the core emits complete dirty sets.
- Added the deterministic Alpha.7 target environment and a fail-closed embodiment controller with authorization, capability checks, per-tick rate limits, emergency stop, human override and hash-linked action audit records.
- Added `docs/03-dashboard/API_REFERENCE.md` for the current dashboard, experiment, parameter and embodiment API contracts.

## 2026-09-01 — v0.5.0-alpha.7 Opened

- Closed Alpha.6 historically at `8fac75da723b4b9d28383dd4ec49497771f4572f`; the release manifest records source freeze `3025e68`, evidence commit `70a4ee2`, baseline 489/5/0, Gate A/B/C PASSED and successful Continuous Integration #145/#147/#148.
- Advanced the canonical package and display version to `0.5.0a7` / `0.5.0-alpha.7`.
- Defined Alpha.7 as Embodiment Foundation & Safe Environment I/O. Read-only discovery is not an exit criterion: deterministic environment I/O, explicit authorization, capability/rate limits, audit, emergency stop and human override remain required.
- Moved Morphological Self-Regulation to Alpha.8 and Memory / World Model / embodied learning to Alpha.9.
- Corrected the roadmap claim for Evidence Scope Digests: global source-tree digest remains authoritative, so scoped digests are still open.
- Restored the post-closure development branch to green with formatting and Git-attribute hygiene; Continuous Integration #152 passed before the Alpha.7 version commit.

## 2026-09-01 — Alpha.6 Phase B Evidence Run (released)

### Source Freeze and Verification
- Scientific source frozen at `f1c4df8adbe8009c2483a72e4f962a6dad9fad83`; Phase B changed evidence and documentation only.
- Continuous Integration #141 passed for the exact source-freeze SHA, including Python 3.11/3.12/3.13, build, Docker, security, docs, lint, and strict type gates.
- Canonical baseline regenerated: **483 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed, 0 collection errors**; source digest `7da20251408617c09ac040455131e33ff4e196ff9a59b419950bfc6c2b4a97e0`.
- Restore A/B/C, Structural E2E, Structural Live Loop, Single Listener, and Determinism Infrastructure artifacts regenerated and verified.
- EXP-DET-0001 and EXP-STOR-0001 rerun as `DATA-2026-15/16` and `EVID-2026-15/16`, with claims, hypotheses, manifests, and data links validated.
- Productive GateStatusBuilder result with source-freeze CI #141: Gate A `22/22`, Gate B `24/24`, Gate C `17/17`; `scientific_gate: passed`.
- Final full evidence-tree validation: 482 passed, 5 skipped, 1 failed. The frozen `test_release_readiness_sections_are_exposed` test hard-codes the pre-evidence expectation `ready is False`, while the now-passed scientific gate correctly produces `True`.
- The source freeze was explicitly reopened for dashboard/runtime hardening; the readiness test now asserts the real gate formula. New local suite: **489 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed, no warnings**.

### Dashboard and Runtime Closure
- Rebuilt OVERVIEW as a responsive operator command center with runtime/health/scientific/CI/release/mode status, live network dynamics, component matrix, current problems, and direct workspace navigation.
- OVERVIEW remains store-driven: gate and experiment mode are loaded through the central state store with throttled supplemental refresh; no panel-specific polling loop was added.
- Added consistent workbench headers and real status summaries to NETWORK, CONTROL, RESEARCH and RELEASE, plus in-page navigation for dense Network/Control workflows.
- Added SCIENTIFIC SETTINGS as a dedicated sixth workspace. It owns the canonical 101-parameter inspector, domain filters, sensitivity/mutability/restart counts, pending-change safeguards, active-session context and synchronized Operator/Experiment/Debug selection.
- CONTROL now focuses on runtime, console, experiment sessions and structural approvals; scientific parameter configuration is no longer mixed into the runtime control flow.
- Reorganized CONTROL around an explicit causal chain: experiment goal → bounded cause → RuntimeController execution → measured effect → log/snapshot/structural evidence. Step, batch and timing inputs now explain their scientific effect directly.
- Corrected Control frontend telemetry mapping to the current `state.runtime` DTO (`controller_state`, `tick`, `queue_depth`, `completed_ticks`, `batch_duration_ms`), so command effects update coherently instead of showing legacy zeros.
- Compacted CONTROL to 1029px at 1920×1080: Runtime and the enlarged Operator Console share the primary row, while the console keeps a 295px evidence log.
- Reduced Structural Live Loop to a quiet 38px disclosure strip; all 10 proof steps remain available on demand.
- Rebuilt the footer as an operational status grid for product/version, runtime, experiment activity/session ID, execution mode and Health. Active experiments are globally visible with a live indicator.
- Standardized every desktop tab to the same viewport-bounded workspace canvas (720–1029px), eliminating layout jumps, page scrolling and fixed-footer overlap between Overview, Network, Control, Research, Release, Settings and Embodiment.
- Split Network into Visual, Dynamics, Inspect and Data subviews and Release into Summary/Gate A/B/C views, keeping every tool reachable without a multi-thousand-pixel page.
- Upgraded Research with reliable quick lanes for all research, evidence, experiments, matrices and documentation; long trees/viewers scroll only inside the fixed workspace.
- All seven workspaces were verified at desktop and 390px mobile widths; wide projection and release criteria remain inspectable without page-level horizontal overflow.
- Unified all dashboard pages on the Overview visual language: full-width 1080p layout, compact workbench headers, flatter tiles, consistent status strips, sticky section jumps and denser Control/Network composition.
- Header now provides Back, Overview, context Help, Dark/Light, explicit Contrast and accessibility controls; the compact footer keeps version, execution mode, runtime and Health visible.
- Network now uses a two-column compact tile layout and real backend controls for live projection resolution, histogram bins and 5D inspector sample count.
- Parameter Inspector exposes a focusable Help marker for every parameter using its real schema description.
- Added an Embodiment workspace backed by the existing `EmbodimentMetrics` dashboard contract. It reports environment, sensors, actuators, episode and rewards, and honestly stays `unconfigured` until an adapter publishes metrics.
- Added read-only `/api/embodiment/state`, `/metrics` and `/history` endpoints plus a six-stage Environment→Sensor→Encoder→SNN→Decoder→Actuator visualization. Missing adapter details remain null/not-reported; no demo state or manual action path is introduced.
- Rebuilt Embodiment as an animated Brain-5D living-system map with a dedicated creature asset. Network, spikes, homeostasis, learning, signal bridge, language organ, knowledge intake, structural growth, storage and embodiment I/O are displayed as body systems from the central state store; activity, energy and synchrony drive only visual intensity, and reduced-motion disables animation.
- Added configurable integrated-dashboard host/port forwarding through `src.main`, the Python launcher and `start.ps1`. Loopback remains the default, trusted-LAN binding is explicit, and the supplied Caddy template provides TLS plus authentication for internet access without exposing operator APIs directly.
- Added the fail-closed Embodiment Connection Manager and `/api/embodiment/connections`. It discovers real compute, storage, LAN/internet routes and platform camera, microphone, audio-output and printer presence while keeping every detected device unauthorized and inactive; extensible descriptors cover future Web/API, database, messaging, display, environment, location and robotics adapters.
- Added the animated dynamic-body connection graph to Embodiment, with separate availability, authorization, activity, relationship, capabilities and provenance indicators sourced through the central dashboard store.
- Hardened Windows launcher process detection/termination against localized `tasklist`/`taskkill` output by decoding subprocess bytes with replacement instead of the active console code page.
- Removed orphaned multi-process runtime state and hardened the launcher against duplicate PIDs and occupied dashboard ports; Windows stop now terminates the complete managed process tree.
- Fixed `start.ps1` / `stop.ps1` repository-root resolution.
- Runtime storage archives a valid journal whose last tick is ahead of a new Tick-0 runtime; restart verification keeps `worker_failed=false`, Health `ok`, and Problems empty.
- Dashboard version defaults and footer now use the canonical `0.5.0-alpha.6` source.
- RELEASE separates Scientific Gate, source-freeze CI, and Release Readiness; CI evidence is accepted only when its SHA and tested source digest match the recorded freeze.
- Operator/Experiment/Debug switching and Network/Control/Research/Release tabs verified in-browser with no console or HTTP errors.
- Parameter Inspector now exposes all 101 public runtime-config leaves; uncurated values remain fixed and restart-required.
- Replaced the broken PlantUML CDN asset and deprecated PyPDF2 dependency; dependency audit reports no known vulnerabilities and package build is warning-free.
- Upgraded GitHub/Docker workflow actions to Node 24-compatible majors, removing Node 20 deprecation annotations.
- Experiment execution now records the exact pytest command, links DATA files from manifests/EVID records automatically, and exits nonzero when either experiment fails.
- Black, Ruff, Mypy, Pyright (`0 errors, 0 warnings`), Pylint (`9.37/10`), Pre-commit, Bandit, tests, and package build pass locally.
- Final source freeze `3025e681a5f46bfd8dc2e5dbb8e1474fa5132cd1`: Continuous Integration #145 passed all jobs, including Python 3.11/3.12/3.13, build, Docker, and `ci-status`, without Node-runtime annotations.
- Final Phase B baseline: **489 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed**, digest `90439f88503e8c22e2babe74f989228f0f99795942f59cdebd5fbeb6920f64a9`.
- Final GateStatusBuilder result: Gate A `22/22`, Gate B `24/24`, Gate C `17/17`; Scientific Gate PASSED and Release Readiness READY.
- Evidence commit `70a4ee253a5fc30716d0ffe0058f146a1ad59cde` passed Continuous Integration #147 (run `33515361366`) across all jobs.
- Final closure commit `8fac75da723b4b9d28383dd4ec49497771f4572f` passed Continuous Integration #148 (run `33515977047`) across all jobs.

### Boundaries
- Sync to Hugging Face #66 remains failed and is explicitly outside CI #141 and this scientific gate.
- The stricter C1-exit-C2 restore orchestration remains a separate hardening task; current path C proves a fresh C2 restore process.
- The source-tree digest excludes generated research evidence although one gate test changes outcome based on that evidence.

## 2026-08-31 — v0.5.0-alpha.6 Opened

### Version Transition
- **Alpha.5**: frozen, tagged `v0.5.0-alpha.5`, gate PASSED.
- **Alpha.6**: opened as current development version `0.5.0-alpha.6` / PEP-440 `0.5.0a6`.
- Added immutable release registry under `releases/` with `/api/releases` and `/api/releases/current`.
- Renamed dashboard `VERIFY` tab to `RELEASE` and added version history tree.
- Archived legacy v0.4 Alpha.6/Alpha.7 files to prevent version collisions.

### Alpha.6 CI Recovery (no scientific dynamics changed)
- Wired Operator/Experiment/Debug mode switching in dashboard (`app.js` + `ExperimentMode`).
- Added backend API tests and static asset regression tests for experiment mode.
- Restored local CI green: Black, Ruff, Pylint ≥9.0, mypy strict, pyright strict.
- Fixed pyright/mypy ignore syntax separation; cleaned redundant casts and unreachable returns.
- GitHub Actions: added `security-events: write` permission for SARIF upload; removed Python setup from docs job.
- Hugging Face sync workflow now fails explicitly if `HF_USERNAME` secret is missing; no GitHub username fallback.
- Updated `GateStatusBuilder` to expose `scientific_gate`, `ci_status`, and `release_readiness` as independent sections.
- **Bandit SAST fix**: now reads `pyproject.toml` config (`-c pyproject.toml`) and gates on Medium/High only (`-ll`); Low findings remain visible in JSON artifact. `pip-audit` stays hard-blocking.

### Opening Verification
- Full test suite: **463 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed**.
- Alpha.6 gate: **OPEN** — no morphological self-regulation feature verified yet.

### Regenerated Evidence
| Artifact | Status | HEAD |
|----------|--------|------|
| `tests/test_baseline.json` | passed | `5f583a6...` |
| `research/generated/verification/determinism_infrastructure.json` | verified | `5f583a6...` |
| `research/generated/verification/restore_determinism.json` | verified (A == B == C) | `5f583a6...` |
| `research/generated/verification/single_listener.json` | verified | `5f583a6...` |
| `research/generated/verification/structural_e2e.json` | verified | `5f583a6...` |
| `research/generated/verification/structural_live_loop.json` | verified | `5f583a6...` |

### Runtime Stability Fixes
- `src/main.py` now reconfigures `stdout`/`stderr` to UTF-8 on startup, preventing `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows consoles / redirected output.
- Runtime delta persistence automatically recovers from a corrupt `latest.b5d.journal` by renaming the damaged file and starting fresh; the canonical `.b5d` snapshot remains the source of truth.

### Notes
- Evidence provenance aligned to the commit that contains the regenerated artefacts.
- Temporary provenance alignment script removed from repository tracking.
- Alpha.5 is now fully closed; work may advance to Alpha.6.

- **Ruff**: 0 lint/import errors after auto-fix pass.
- **Pytest**: 454 passed, 2 skipped (large-storage slow tests), 1 external deprecation warning.

### Backend fixes
- **`src/dashboard/models.py`**: Replaced mutable `None` defaults for `components`, `parameters`, `pending_changes` with typed `field(default_factory=...)` to eliminate unnecessary `is None` comparisons and unknown-type diagnostics.
- **`src/dashboard/server.py`**: Added explicit casts for `int()` conversions and `_send_json` payloads containing `list[str]` values.
- **`src/dashboard/health_builder.py`**: Tightened `_is_enabled` / `_nested_get` typing to avoid partially-unknown `dict` diagnostics.
- **`src/dashboard/file_manager.py`**: Added missing `_root()` helper and typed `history` list; removed unnecessary casts.
- **`src/research/canonical_state.py`**: Switched protocol `neurons`/`synapses`/`event_slots` properties to covariant `Mapping` / `Sequence` so real network types match the protocol.
- **`src/storage/checkpoint.py`** / **`src/storage/core_restore.py`**: Added `# pyright: ignore[reportPrivateUsage]` markers for intentional internal field access.

### Test fixes
- **`tests/conftest.py`**: Renamed `TestConfig` to `Config` to avoid pytest collection warning.

- **`tests/_restore_helpers.py`**: Added private-usage ignores and removed unused `Path` import.

## 2026-08-30 — Verification Audit: Restore Verified, Evidence Scopes Required

### Verification Status
- **Restore A/B/C determinism** is now verified (`A == B == C`, tested at commit `93620ecc...`).
- **Structural E2E** and **Structural Live Loop** are verified.
- **Test baseline** `tests/test_baseline.json` is stale (2026-08-28, 418 passed / 3 failed / 2 skipped, commit `39a4b6e...`); full suite must be re-run and baseline regenerated.
- **Evidence-freshness model** is too coarse: dashboard/UI changes under `src/dashboard/` currently invalidate restore/structural evidence artifacts. This must be replaced with scoped evidence digests.

### Architecture Findings
- `StateStore` exists but is not yet the single source of truth: `app.js` still issues parallel requests to `/api/gate/status`, `/api/structural/errors`, `/api/integration/status`, `/api/snapshot-info`, `/api/heatmap`, etc.
- `ControlPanel` and `OperatorConsole` both register runtime keyboard shortcuts, creating a double-shortcut bug.
- `HealthBuilder` conflates `enabled` with `active` for Learning and reports Verification as `active` based only on endpoint availability rather than actual gate/evidence state.
- `tmp/restore_diag/` and `tmp/trace_diag/` contain checked-in diagnostic state dumps that should not live in the normal source tree.

### Next Steps
1. Make `ControlPanel` the sole command owner; remove runtime shortcuts from `OperatorConsole`.
2. Introduce evidence scope digests so UI changes do not mark scientific proofs stale.
3. Fix health-state semantics: `enabled ≠ active`, `unavailable ≠ disabled`, verification status reflects gate state.
4. Source freeze → full test suite → new baseline → regenerate all evidence artifacts.

## 2026-08-30 — Dashboard Operator-Workbench Design Decision

### Design Decision: From Feature Dashboard to Operator Workbench

- **Information architecture** moves from module-oriented layout to workflow-oriented
  layout aligned with `observe → understand → modify → verify → document`.
- **Top-level tabs** become: `OVERVIEW | NETWORK | CONTROL | RESEARCH | VERIFY`.
- **OVERVIEW** shrinks to four sections: `SYSTEM`, `NETWORK`, `ADAPTATION`, `HEALTH`.
  Roadmap and integration status move to `RESEARCH`/`VERIFY`.
- **NETWORK** gains subtabs `Live`, `Dynamics`, `Structure`, `Inspector` for progressive
  disclosure from coarse to fine-grained observation.
- **CONTROL** becomes the single workbench for input. `Runtime Control` and
  `Operator Console` are unified; Console becomes output-only log.
- **VERIFY** replaces `RELEASE` and covers `Health`, `Tests`, `Determinism`,
  `Persistence`, `Integration`, `Evidence Freshness`, `Release Gate`.
- **Health/Problems** becomes a permanent, cross-cutting concern (top-right status
  bar + right/bottom drawers) instead of hidden panels.
- **Parameter system** introduces `current / configured / default` semantics,
  runtime-mutable flags, restart requirements, and pending-change workflow.
- **Status model** standardizes component states: `enabled`, `active`, `degraded`,
  `unavailable`, `error`, `stale`, `disabled`, each with `reason`, `last_update`,
  `source`, `last_error`, `maturity`.
- **State store** centralizes dashboard state instead of letting every panel fetch
  independently.
- **Experiment Mode** adds `Operator / Experiment / Debug` switch with logged
  experiment metadata and extra debug instrumentation.
- **Frontend modularization** target: `app.js` limited to bootstrap, routing,
  module lifecycle, global health, global state; domain logic split into
  `overview/`, `network/`, `control/`, `console/`, `research/`, `verify/`,
  `components/`.

## 2026-08-30 — Dashboard Cleanup & Alpha.5 Hygiene

### Dashboard-Informationsarchitektur vereinfacht
- **`src/dashboard/static/index.html`**:
  - `OVERVIEW` entdoppelt: Roadmap und Integration-Status entfernt; neue
    **Active Profile**-Card.
  - `CONTROL & CONSOLE` entdoppelt: `Runtime Control` umbenannt zu
    **Runtime Configuration** und auf Loop-Size, Delay und Self-Organization
    reduziert. Operator Console bleibt die zentrale Bedienfläche für Step,
    Run, Pause, Resume, Stop, Snapshot, Undo, Console Log und Proposals.
  - Gemeinsame Loop-Size für `Run N Ticks` aus Runtime Configuration.
- **`src/dashboard/static/control-panel.js`**: Entfernt redundante
  Steuerbuttons (Step/Run/Pause/Stop/Snapshot); behält Konfiguration und
  Self-Organization.
- **`src/dashboard/static/operator_console.js`**: `Run N Ticks` liest jetzt
  die gemeinsame `#loop-size`; Shortcuts auf `Ctrl+Shift+R` = Run,
  `Ctrl+Shift+P` = Pause, `Ctrl+Shift+Space` = Stop harmonisiert.
- **`src/dashboard/static/styles.css`**: Stil für `loop-size-hint` hinzugefügt.
- **`src/dashboard/static/app.js`**: Header-Kommentar auf die aktuellen fünf
  Hauptbereiche aktualisiert.

### Repository-Hygiene

  aktueller Fast-Suite-Stand (397 passed / 0 failed) und offener A/B/C-Fehler
  dokumentiert.

### Tests
- **`tests/test_restore_determinism_abc.py`**: Fehlendes `--digest-k`
  Argument für Path-C-Worker ergänzt (worker startet wieder). A/B/C bleibt
  aufgrund der A/B-Divergenz nach Restore offen.

## 2026-08-30 — BibTeX Viewer für Literaturverwaltung im Dashboard

  - Neu: ID-Format-Test für Quellen (`SRC-{AUTHOR}-{YEAR}`).
  - Neu: Referenz-Tests für Literaturangaben in Fragen, Quellenangaben in Claims und Fragenreferenzen in Quellen.
  - Neu: Pflichtfeld-Test für alle Registry-Typen.

## 2026-08-29 — Dynamics Tab + Collapsible Architecture

### Neuer Dynamics Tab (Spike Raster, Rate Histogram, 5D Layer Explorer)
- **`src/dashboard/static/index.html`**: New "📈 Dynamics" tab with three panels:
  - **Spike Raster**: Canvas-drawn scatter plot of recent spike times (last 100 ticks) for the most active neurons. Shows spike density and firing patterns over time.
  - **Feuerraten-Histogramm**: Bar chart showing the distribution of firing rates across all neurons. Includes mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) overlay, plus silent/active neuron counts.
  - **5D Layer Explorer**: Interactive slice through the 5D space. User selects dimension (Z, d4, d5), layer value via slider, and display kind (activity, energy, membrane). The heatmap updates in real-time.
- **`src/dashboard/static/app.js`**: New `initDynamicsTab()`, `refreshSpikeRaster()`, `drawSpikeRaster()`, `refreshRateHistogram()`, `drawRateHistogram()`, `refreshLayerExplorer()`, `drawLayerSlice()` functions. Lazy-initialized when tab is first clicked.
- **`src/dashboard/static/styles.css`**: New styles for raster, histogram, and layer explorer panels with dark theme canvas backgrounds and slider controls.

### Backend: Rate Histogram & Spike Raster Endpoints
- **`src/dashboard/live_projection.py`**: New `RateHistogramData`/`compute_rate_histogram()` — computes firing rate distribution with 30 bins, mean/median/std statistics, and silent/active counts.
- **`src/dashboard/live_projection.py`**: New `SpikeRasterData`/`compute_spike_raster()` — extracts recent spike times from the activity accumulator window for the most active neurons.
- **`src/dashboard/server.py`**: New `GET /api/live/histogram` and `GET /api/live/raster` endpoints.

### Tab-Architektur: Lazy Loading für Performance
- Dynamics Tab wird nur initialisiert, wenn der Benutzer ihn das erste Mal anklickt. Keine Canvas-Rendering-Last im Dashboard-Tab.
- Alle Dynamics-Panels haben eigene Refresh-Intervalle (2s Raster/Histogram, 3s Layer Explorer).

### Documentation
- `docs/changelog.md`: This entry.
- `docs/todo.md`: Added new API endpoints to truth sources list.

## 2026-08-28 — Dashboard Hardening + Engine Attach Fix

### Dashboard Disconnect Hardening
- **`src/dashboard/server.py`**: `_send_json()` now wraps the entire HTTP response emission (send_response, send_header, end_headers, wfile.write) in a single try/except for BrokenPipeError, ConnectionResetError, ConnectionAbortedError. Previously only wfile.write was protected.
- **`src/dashboard/server.py`**: `_handle_exception()` immediately returns for client disconnect errors at the top of the method, preventing a second write attempt on a dead socket.
- **`tests/test_dashboard_disconnect_hardening.py`**: 6 new regression tests covering disconnect at every stage of response emission.

### Engine Attach Fix (one confirmed cause of restore divergence)
- **`src/storage/core_restore.py`**: `restore_full()` now calls `.attach()` on created homeostasis and learning engines. Without attach(), the engines were passive — they existed but were not registered as post-step hooks. This was one confirmed cause of Path C divergence in the A/B/C protocol.
- After this fix, A and C match at K (restore point), but still diverge during K→N due to synapse list order after file restore affecting learning engine iteration.
- **B/C protocol not yet fully compliant** until fresh-process proof passes (see below).

### Restore A/B/C Protocol Correction
- **`tests/test_restore_determinism_abc.py`**: Complete protocol rewrite:
  - Path B now uses production `restore_full()` and asserts the restored network is a **different object**.
  - Path C now uses a real **subprocess** (`tests/_restore_worker.py`) — C1 runs 0→K in-process, C2 runs via `subprocess.run()` in a fresh Python process.
  - Stimulus schedule is now **absolute ticks** 0..N-1, serialized as JSON, shared by A, B, and C2.
  - All artifact proof fields are **machine-measured**, never hardcoded.
  - Artifact includes `pid_C1`, `pid_C2`, `config_sha256`, and all proof booleans.
- **Results**: `fresh_process_is_real=True` (PID 27804 vs 30296), `production_restore_path_used=True`, B==C. But A still diverges from B/C — the restore itself produces a different final state than uninterrupted running.

## 2026-08-26 — Pre-Experiment Closure Sprint (Part 1)

### Gate Evidence Binding (Breaking Change)
- **`src/dashboard/gate_status.py`**: Replaced file-existence-based determinism checks with verification artifact (`research/generated/verification/determinism_infrastructure.json`). File existence alone no longer produces VERIFIED/PASSED status.
- Added `REQUIRED_DETERMINISM_PROOFS` with 7 proof IDs.
- Added `_read_determinism_artifact()` and `_determinism_infrastructure_verified()` methods with fail-closed validation.
- Error visibility criteria (experiment validity) now also use the determinism artifact.
- **`scripts/generate_determinism_artifact.py`**: New script to run determinism tests and produce the verification artifact.

### LearningEngine Determinism (Bug Fix)
- **`src/learning/learning_engine.py`**: Changed `_states` key from `id(synapse)` (Python memory address, non-deterministic across restarts) to stable `(pre_id, target_id)` tuples.
- Changed `events` dict key from `id(synapse)` to `(pre_id, target_id)`.
- Changed `set(spike_ids)` iteration to `sorted(set(...))` for deterministic order.
- Changed `events.values()` iteration to `sorted(events)` for deterministic order.
- Updated `get_eligibility()` and `_process_synapse_event()` to use stable keys.

### Production Restore Bundle (New Feature)
- **`src/storage/core_restore.py`**: Added `RestoredBundle` dataclass and `restore_full()` function that restores network + HomeostasisEngine + LearningEngine atomically.
- Fixed `restore_learning_state()` to use stable `(pre_id, target_id)` key lookup instead of linear scan with `id(synapse)` matching.
- Fixed `restore_learning_state()` to set `EligibilityTrace.value` instead of non-existent `_trace`.

### Tests
- **`tests/test_production_restore.py`**: New test file with 3 tests covering full restore bundle, engine-less restore, and continue-determinism.
- **`tests/test_engine_restore.py`**: Updated to use stable key lookup and correct `eligibility.value` attribute.

### Documentation
- `docs/todo.md`: Updated baseline to 367 passed, added determinism artifact info, updated gate status.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: Created with current status and future plans.
- `docs/changelog.md`: This file.

### Baseline
- `tests/test_baseline.json`: Updated to 367 passed, tree digest `dcd2d461...`.
- `research/generated/verification/determinism_infrastructure.json`: Created with 7/7 proofs verified.

## 2026-08-26 — Live Visualization & Verification Freshness Sprint (Part 2)

### Verification Artifact Generation Fix (Bug Fix)
- **`scripts/generate_determinism_artifact.py`**: Replaced custom `compute_tree_digest()` with canonical `compute_source_tree_digest()` from `src.dashboard.verification`. The custom function had different file filtering (only `.py/.toml/.yaml/.json/.cfg/.md`) and no path-interleaving, producing a different digest than the canonical function.
- Added `sys.path.insert(0, str(REPO_ROOT))` so the script can import from `src/`.
- Added `current_git_head()` function for provenance tracking.

### Verification Semantics Cleanup
- **`tests/test_structural_e2e.py`**, **`tests/test_structural_live_loop.py`**, **`tests/test_single_listener.py`**: Changed artifact field from `tested_commit` to `test_run_head` for semantic clarity. The tree digest is the freshness authority; commit hash is provenance only.
- **`scripts/generate_determinism_artifact.py`**: Uses `test_run_head` instead of `tested_commit`.

### Live Projection Service (New Feature)
- **`src/dashboard/live_projection.py`**: New module — `LiveProjectionService` reads directly from the in-memory `NeuralNetwork`, never from `.b5d` snapshots. Supports 5 projection kinds (activity, energy, membrane, spike, weight) with configurable aggregation (mean, max, sum, spike_count, active_fraction) and resolution (bins).
- **`src/dashboard/operator_bridge.py`**: Added `live_projection` attribute with automatic `LiveProjectionService` creation from the controller's network.
- **`src/dashboard/server.py`**: Added `GET /api/live/projection` endpoint with parameters: `kind`, `dimension_x`, `dimension_y`, `resolution`, `aggregation`. Response tagged as `live_runtime`.
- **`src/dashboard/heatmap_source.py`**: Added `source: str = "snapshot"` field to `HeatmapPayload` to distinguish from live data.

### LIVE vs SNAPSHOT Separation
- **`src/dashboard/static/index.html`**: Added `#source-badge` element showing LIVE or SNAPSHOT. Added `#live-toggle` button. Added membrane and spike kind buttons. Changed subtitle to show source badge.
- **`src/dashboard/static/app.js`**: Added `liveSource` toggle variable. Added `refreshLiveProjection()` function polling `/api/live/projection` at 500ms. Added `updateSourceBadge()` function. Heatmap metadata now shows source prefix (LIVE/SNAPSHOT).
- **`src/dashboard/static/styles.css`**: Added `.badge`, `.badge-live`, `.badge-snapshot`, `.provenance-badge` styles with distinct green (LIVE) and amber (SNAPSHOT) colors.

### Tests
- **`tests/test_live_projection.py`**: 12 tests covering energy accuracy, activity timing, weight projection, tick coherence, no-mutation guarantee, snapshot separation, bounded payload, and invalid parameter handling.

- **`src/dashboard/server.py`**: New `GET /api/live/io-flow` endpoint that reads directly from the live network. Uses the TelemetryFrameStore's ActivityWindowAccumulator for rolling window rates.
- **`src/dashboard/static/index.html`**: New IO-Fluss panel with three-layer flow visualization (Input → Hidden → Output), activity bars, rate displays, and propagation status badge.
- **`src/dashboard/static/app.js`**: New `refreshIOFlow()` function polling `/api/live/io-flow` at 2s intervals. Updates flow bars, layer stats, and propagation badge.
- **`src/dashboard/static/styles.css`**: New `.io-flow-panel`, `.io-flow-grid`, `.io-flow-layer` styles with color-coded layer borders (input=teal, hidden=blue, output=amber).

### Populationen-Übersicht (New Feature)
- **`src/dashboard/live_projection.py`**: New `PopulationData`/`_PopulationEntry` dataclasses and `compute_population_data()` function that groups neurons by type (excitatory, inhibitory, sensory_input, motor_output) with per-population statistics.
- **`src/dashboard/server.py`**: New `GET /api/live/population` endpoint returning population metrics including E/I ratio.
- **`src/dashboard/static/index.html`**: New Population panel with dynamic card grid showing per-type stats and active-fraction progress bars.
- **`src/dashboard/static/app.js`**: New `refreshPopulation()` function polling `/api/live/population` at 2s intervals. Renders population cards with rate, energy, membrane V, and activity bars.
- **`src/dashboard/static/styles.css`**: New `.population-panel`, `.population-card`, `.population-bar` styles with color-coded progress bars per population type.

### Verbesserte 5D Isometrische Projektion
- **`src/dashboard/static/app.js`**: Enhanced `draw5DProjection()` with isometric floor grid, axis labels (X, Y), Z-range legend, and 5D dimension info overlay. Better visual depth perception with grid dots and glow effects.

### Documentation
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: Added Dashboard Enhancement Sprint section with 4 completed items.
- `docs/changelog.md`: This entry.
- `docs/todo.md`: Added new dashboard API endpoints to truth sources list.

### Verification Freshness Restored
- All 5 verification artifacts now share the same `tested_tree_digest`.
- `tests/test_baseline.json`: 379 passed, 0 failed, 2 skipped.

### Baseline
- `tests/test_baseline.json`: 379 passed, canonical tree digest.
- All structural and determinism artifacts regenerated with matching digests.

## 2026-08-26 — Live Visualization Correctness Sprint (Part 3)

### Critical Bug Fixes

1. **`unpack_coords` correction** — `LiveProjectionService` now uses `src.core.spatial_index.unpack_coords()` (the canonical packed-5D decoder) instead of a custom `_unpack_coord()` that treated neuron IDs as linear row-major indices. This was the root cause of neurons appearing in wrong spatial bins.

2. **Activity is now a real firing-rate estimate** — Replaced `1.0 / max(1, age)` (recency of last spike) with `1.0 / window` (firing rate over the activity window). The old implementation gave identical activity to neurons with very different spike counts if their last spike was equally recent.

3. **Empty bins = null, not 0** — Bins with no neurons now return `None` in the `values` array, with a corresponding `mask` boolean array. The range (min/max/mean) is computed only over non-empty bins. This prevents empty regions from distorting the color scale.

4. **Aggregation semantics are now correct** — `_final_value()` dispatches correctly:
   - `mean`: sum/count
   - `sum` / `spike_count`: raw sum (no division)
   - `max`: stored max value (separate accumulator)
   - `active_fraction`: active_count / total_count

5. **MAX works with negative values** — Changed MAX accumulator initialization from `0.0` to `float("-inf")`. Membrane potentials (-70mV to -50mV) now correctly resolve their maximum.

6. **Dimension validation** — `dim_x` and `dim_y` must differ and be in 0..4. Raises `ValueError` otherwise.

7. **TelemetryFrame** — Introduced `capture_frame()` that atomically captures all neuron/synapse state from a single tick into an immutable `TelemetryFrame`. The `LiveProjectionService.project()` reads from the frame, not directly from the live network, preventing incoherent reads across a concurrently stepping simulation.

### Tests
- **`tests/test_live_projection.py`**: Expanded from 12 to 24 tests. New tests cover:
  - Known 5D coordinate lands in expected bin (H)
  - Empty bin is null, not 0 (I)
  - Mask matches null values (I)
  - MAX with negative membrane potentials (J)
  - Spiking vs silent neuron activity difference (K)
  - TelemetryFrame tick/neuron/synapse coherence (L)
  - Invalid dimension axes and values (M)

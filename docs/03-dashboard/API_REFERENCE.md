# Dashboard API Reference

The local dashboard exposes JSON APIs on the configured loopback or trusted-LAN
address. Read endpoints report the shared dashboard state; mutation endpoints
are explicit operator or experiment commands.

## Runtime and Health

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/healthz` | Process liveness check. |
| `GET` | `/api/state` | Current store-driven dashboard snapshot. |
| `GET` | `/api/config` | Effective configuration path, digest and runtime configuration. |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Aggregated component health and problems. |
| `GET` | `/api/components` | Component status inventory. |
| `GET` | `/api/components/{name}` | One component status. |
| `GET` | `/api/parameters` | Public parameter schemas. |
| `GET` | `/api/parameters/{name}` | One parameter schema and current value. |

## Pending Parameters

Parameter changes are staged before application:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/parameters/pending` | List staged changes. |
| `POST` | `/api/parameters/{name}/pending` | Stage one parameter value. |
| `POST` | `/api/parameters/pending/apply` | Apply staged runtime-mutable changes. |
| `POST` | `/api/parameters/pending/save-profile` | Apply and persist a profile. |
| `POST` | `/api/parameters/pending/cancel` | Discard staged changes. |

## Experiment State

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/experiment/mode` | Current state mode and active session. |
| `POST` | `/api/experiment/mode` | Set the dashboard session mode. Current API values are `operator`, `experiment` or compatibility `debug`; the persisted runtime state axis uses `dev`. |
| `GET` | `/api/experiment/sessions` | Session history. |
| `POST` | `/api/experiment/session/start` | Start a bounded, documented session. |
| `POST` | `/api/experiment/session/stop` | Stop the active session. |
| `POST` | `/api/experiment/note` | Add a note to the active session. |
| `GET` | `/api/experiment/workflow/catalog` | List registered workflows. |
| `POST` | `/api/experiment/workflow/run` | Run a validated bounded workflow. |

Experiment execution is isolated from the persistent operator state. A
workflow cannot promote state automatically.

## Profile & Identity

Profiles are bounded technical configuration identities. They are separate from
the `.b5d` snapshot and runtime checkpoint, and do not imply psychological or
conscious identity.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/profiles` | List bounded registry metadata. |
| `GET` | `/api/profiles/current` | Current persisted technical identity. |
| `GET` | `/api/profiles/{id}` | Validate and return one profile. |
| `POST` | `/api/profiles` | Create a schema-validated profile. |
| `PUT` | `/api/profiles/{id}` | Create a revision from explicit changes. |
| `POST` | `/api/profiles/{id}/load` | Load profile-only or profile plus bound state. |
| `POST` | `/api/profiles/{id}/save-state` | Bind an existing snapshot by digest. |
| `POST` | `/api/profiles/{id}/clone` | Create a new profile with lineage. |
| `POST` | `/api/profiles/{id}/archive` | Archive a profile and clear active assignment safely. |
| `GET` | `/api/profiles/{id}/history` | Revision and parent history. |
| `GET` | `/api/profiles/{id}/snapshots` | Snapshot references, not snapshot contents. |
| `GET` | `/api/profiles/{id}/export` | Download bounded ZIP export. |
| `POST` | `/api/profiles/import` | Import a base64 ZIP after security/digest validation. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/profiles/{id}` | Hard delete only when no active/provenance guard applies; otherwise archive. |

## Embodiment Read APIs

The GET endpoints publish only measured or discovered state. Sensor lifecycle
mutations are explicit and fail closed:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/embodiment/state` | Environment status and latest metrics. |
| `GET` | `/api/embodiment/metrics` | Latest embodiment metrics. |
| `GET` | `/api/embodiment/history?limit=N` | Retained metrics history, bounded by `limit`. |
| `GET` | `/api/embodiment/connections` | Discovered connections and authorization state. |
| `GET` | `/api/embodiment/sensors` | Registered sensor lifecycle state and recent activation audit. |
| `GET` | `/api/embodiment/sensors/{id}` | One sensor lifecycle descriptor and its audit records. |
| `POST` | `/api/embodiment/sensors/{id}/enable` | Enable one sensor only when adapter, authorization and safety checks pass. |
| `POST` | `/api/embodiment/sensors/{id}/disable` | Explicitly disable one sensor and append an audit record. |

Device discovery does not authorize or activate a connection. Writable adapter
execution requires the fail-closed embodiment safety boundary: availability,
explicit authorization, capability permission, rate limit, audit record and
emergency-stop/override checks.

## Cognition Read APIs

Memory and world-model records remain bounded engineering telemetry. The
dashboard cannot inject arbitrary memory content.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/cognition/status` | Shared cognition summary for the Wesen surface. |
| `GET` | `/api/cognition/memory` | Memory controls, capacities, retention and integrity digest. |
| `GET` | `/api/cognition/memory/episodes?limit=N` | Recalled bounded episodes, subject to `read_enabled`. |
| `GET` | `/api/cognition/predictions?limit=N` | Prediction/error records, subject to `read_enabled`. |
| `GET` | `/api/cognition/world-model` | Observation-only bounded model state and boundary. |
| `GET` | `/api/cognition/behavior-profile` | Operational behavior profile and update log. |
| `POST` | `/api/cognition/memory/controls` | Explicitly set `read_enabled` and `write_enabled` only. |

Gateway lifecycle mutations remain experiment-scoped at
`/api/experiments/{id}/gateway/{activate|pause|resume|stop}`. Productive gateway
activation has no general endpoint and remains locked.

The machine-readable backend/frontend contract is maintained in
`docs/03-dashboard/BACKEND_FRONTEND_COVERAGE.json`.

## Contract Rules

- JSON errors use an HTTP error status and an `error` field.
- `GET` endpoints do not mutate runtime state.
- Experiment and operator state are separate lifecycle boundaries.
- `compute` observability may suppress rendering, but mandatory health,
  provenance and safety evidence remain available.

## External review integration

`GET /api/research/external-review` returns public, instrument-digest-bound
readiness and pending assessment stages. It does not query the private
collector, expose participant identities, record reviewer decisions, or grant
ethics approval. Response counts remain null. Missing or changed instrument
bytes yield `available: false`. No write route exists.


## Stage-6 reference compatibility (2026-09-14)

`GET /api/cognition/predictions?limit=N` retains the existing record fields and adds `error_components` per returned record: `numeric_absolute`, `categorical_mismatch`, `missing_fields`, `unsupported_fields`, `target_fields`, `coverage`, and the explicitly non-accuracy `legacy_mean_error`. Values are computed from the stored prediction/observation pair; no state or historical files are mutated. `limit` remains bounded by 128; the cognition panel requests at most 20 and exports only that bounded view.

`GET /api/cognition/world-model` adds boolean `prediction_enabled` and `learning_enabled`. These are independent of episodic read/write controls and are not new mutation endpoints. `POST /api/cognition/memory/controls` continues to accept only explicit boolean `read_enabled` and `write_enabled`.

When reading is disabled, the episode/prediction lists are empty, the model body is withheld, and `/api/cognition/state` returns `latest_prediction: null`. Availability/read flags distinguish a denied read from an actual empty memory. Counts and controls remain operational metadata. This is an experiment-control contract, not authentication or retroactive deletion of earlier exports.

A missing request result renders unavailable, not measured zero or an active badge. The bounded JSON export is not a replay input. See [rebuild protocol](../../research/specifications/STAGE6_REPLAY_FORMAT.md) and [integration audit](../07-changelog/2026-09-14_STAGES_0_6_INTEGRATION.md).

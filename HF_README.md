# Multi-Scale Homeostatic Recurrence Network (MHRN)

## Mehrskaliges homöostatisches Rekurrenznetzwerk

**Sparse 5D spiking-neural research framework with controlled plasticity, embodiment, peripheral multi-network integration and scientific provenance.**

MHRN is an experimental framework for studying learning, self-organization and embodied closed-loop behavior in a sparse five-dimensional spiking neural network. The SNN remains the primary adaptive system; language models, research assistants and peripheral neural networks are bounded interpretation/proposal/adapter components unless explicitly registered as experimental treatments.

> MHRN does not claim AGI, consciousness, sentience or biological equivalence. Passing implementation tests, reachable devices or available neural pipelines are not the same as scientific evidence.

## Status and provenance

The package version describes software, not validated cognition. GitHub main is canonical; this mirror is derived. Current verification must be checked against its exact source hashes in the repository. Historical reports remain dated records.

## Live dashboard Space

The interactive operator and research dashboard is published separately as a Docker Space. The current Hugging Face Space still uses its legacy repository slug for continuity:

https://huggingface.co/spaces/superdigger/Brain-5D-Space

## Capabilities

- sparse 5D Izhikevich SNN with delayed events and deterministic RNG state;
- STDP, signed eligibility and delayed reward / three-factor learning;
- Learning Preparation Studio with partition leakage guards;
- homeostasis, bounded interoception, component-level energy accounting and provenance classes;
- structural proposals, explicit approval, mutation, journal, undo and recovery, plus heatmap/history/config APIs;
- `.b5d` snapshots, delta journals, checkpoints, deterministic restore/continue, v0.6 frozen binary contract;
- typed embodiment, actuator authorization, audit trails, deterministic environments, individual sensor lifecycle controls;
- real host telemetry/device discovery without fabricated fallback values;
- **Neural Symbiosis**: open-set peripheral neural/virtual area contracts, experiment-only gateway runtime with Frozen/Random/Shuffle controls, productive activation LOCKED;

- **Scientific Observatory**: 12-tab metrics workbench with live spike-window, topology, criticality, learning and provenance groups;
- **Full API integration**: all 130 backend routes consumed by 7+ frontend panels with auto-refresh;
- responsive dashboard centered on Overview, Control, Research, Settings, Wesen, Embodiment, Release/Gate;
- natural German read-aloud controls for File Viewer previews, chat file cards and Research Chat answers.

## Research Catalog and dimensions

Canonical `questions.yaml` / `hypotheses.yaml` can be extended through deterministic `questions.*.yaml` / `hypotheses.*.yaml` fragments. MSBA research questions and hypotheses are normal experiment-workflow entries. A question is marked operational only when an appropriate frozen/preregistered protocol exists; otherwise it remains exploratory and cannot be silently promoted to evidence.

Accepted canonical registry changes regenerate current catalog, evidence and open-question reports. Historical experiment-owned reports are preserved unchanged.

MSBA/external projection spaces may use 1–32 dimensions. The persisted productive SNN core remains 5D for backward compatibility until a separately versioned N-D neuron-ID, spatial-index and `.b5d` migration has been implemented and verified.

## Neural Symbiosis

The embodiment layer can represent dedicated processing stages between endpoints and the 5D-SNN:

```text
Camera → CNN / Vision Transformer → gateway → 5D-SNN
Microphone → Audio/Speech Transformer → gateway → 5D-SNN
Database / Knowledge Graph → GNN/projector → gateway → 5D-SNN
Logic engine → neuro-symbolic projector → gateway → 5D-SNN
5D-SNN → gateway → speech/control network → audio/robotics output
```

The adapter model is open-set and framework-neutral. CNN, Transformer, LSTM/GRU/RNN, GNN, Modern Hopfield, reservoir/ESN, MLP, VAE/GAN/diffusion, autoencoder, peripheral SNN, multimodal, neuro-symbolic and custom architectures can be represented without importing their runtime frameworks into the MHRN core.

Gateway plasticity is **disabled by default**. Pipeline reachability or area registration is not evidence that the SNN learned to use an external area. Plastic gateway experiments require explicit preregistration, persisted RNG/model/version provenance, matched controls and the normal DATA/EVID review path.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thomas-Heisig/MHRN.git
cd MHRN
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m src.main --config configs/poc_config.yaml
```

Windows PowerShell activation:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev]"
.\start.ps1
```

The dashboard defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.

## Current research focus

The engineering foundation is broad enough that the next priority is **evidence closure rather than feature accumulation**:

1. operationalize every still-unmapped canonical RQ/H with dedicated protocols and preregistrations;
2. post-repair propagation/recurrence validation across independent seeds;
3. productive learning with holdout and matched controls;
4. closed-loop embodiment versus replay/open-loop controls;
5. experiment-only Neural Symbiosis/MSBA gateway studies with frozen/random/shuffled controls;
6. preregistered N-D projection sweeps before any productive-core N-D migration;
7. simulation-time versus wall-clock pacing calibration;
8. causal ablations of the 5D organization;
9. self-regulation/sensor-loss studies;
10. later memory/world-model, multimodal grounding and AI-as-treatment studies.

## Scientific boundary

```text
implementation test != experiment data != accepted evidence != interpretation
```

Observed values remain distinct from inferred values. Missing telemetry remains unknown. Device availability is not authorization. AI output is not empirical measurement. Pipeline reachability is not learned tool use.

## Empirical results / Messstand 2026-09-10

Original campaign: 1272 seed/condition records; execution states `{'completed': 28, 'failed': 1}`. Addressing-only amendment: 15 records; states `{'completed': 1}`. Twenty-two human reviews remain pending; 43 questions still lack their own operational runner.

Native synthetic association: 78.5% vs 50% for each of four controls, paired difference 28.5 percentage points, pointwise 95% bootstrap CI [20,37], Holm-p 0.0078125 (ten paired seeds). No supported 5D propagation advantage (all Holm-p 1). Brian2 exact single-cell conformance failed in all three runs; this negative is retained. Original scaling failed at coordinate 256; its addressing amendment and results are recorded separately. These are exploratory DATA, not accepted EVID, general cognition, independent replication or ethics approval.

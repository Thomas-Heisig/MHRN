"""Regression tests: client disconnect during JSON response does not propagate.

The dashboard server must gracefully handle client disconnects at any
point during HTTP response emission — ``send_response``, ``send_header``,
``end_headers``, or ``wfile.write`` — without raising or entering the
error buffer.
